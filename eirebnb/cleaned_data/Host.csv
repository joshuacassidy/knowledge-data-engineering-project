17165187,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/17165187,Joanne & Tony,"Hello, we are Tony and Joanne Burke owners of Burkedale House for 19 years. We bought it after we moved to Ireland in 2001. Tony is originally from Dublin and Joanne from Oxford. We met over 30 years ago in London. We wanted our children, Naomi & Hamish to be educated in Ireland hence the move to Clare in 2001. The proximity to Shannon Airport was key in our choice of location as Tony, an IT Consultant, commuted for work. Tony was familiar with the county from his rock climbing days and Joanne was soon to fall in love with its diversity. When the children flew the nest and went to university in the UK we decided to head back to the UK too. We wanted other people to enjoy the spectacular views from the house and relax in its comfortable surroundings and began our Airbnb journey. After 6 years back in the UK Joanne retired from her nursing career and we returned to Burkedale House and bought the cottage at the end of the garden. 6 months was spent renovating the 100 year old traditional Irish cottage before welcoming our first guests in April 2018. At the same time we started to offer B&B in the house. We also had a new addition to the family, our border collie, Bali who is a real hit with the guests. Last year we were adopted by Hermione a black and white cat who thought this was a nice place to live! We could not be more delighted with the success of the business and love welcoming guests from around the world. For 2020 we have added our newly renovated Garden Suite, self catering accommodation for 2 people. We of course still have the cottage and 1 B&B room, ( we are not currently offering B&B due to Covid-19) In addition to running the accommodation we are both Nordic Walking instructors working through our sister company Nordic Fitness Ireland We can arrange learn to Nordic Walk courses and guided or self guided walks for our guests ( booking and additional cost required). We always enjoy the 5k circular walk / run from the house round to the monastery and Dysert O’Dea Castle. We love to travel and have visited many places around the world memories of which can be seen on our numerous fridge magnets and landscape photos around the house, and world map in the Garden Suite.

ABOUT ME A friendly funny guy, not too noisy, not too quiet. Always ready for a beer or to help with a puncture! PHILOSOPHY Live as the hummingbird story- One day a terrible fire broke out in a forest - a huge woodlands was suddenly engulfed by a raging wild fire. Frightened, all the animals fled their homes and ran out of the forest. As they came to the edge of a stream they stopped to watch the fire and they were feeling very discouraged and powerless. They were all bemoaning the destruction of their homes. Every one of them thought there was nothing they could do about the fire, except for one little hummingbird. This particular hummingbird decided it would do something. It swooped into the stream and picked up a few drops of water and went into the forest and put them on the fire. Then it went back to the stream and did it again, and it kept going back, again and again and again. All the other animals watched in disbelief; some tried to discourage the hummingbird with comments like, ""Don't bother, it is too much, you are too little, your wings will burn, your beak is too tiny, it’s only a drop, you can't put out this fire."" And as the animals stood around disparaging the little bird’s efforts, the bird noticed how hopeless and forlorn they looked. Then one of the animals shouted out and challenged the hummingbird in a mocking voice, ""What do you think you are doing?"" And the hummingbird, without wasting time or losing a beat, looked back and said, ""I am doing what I can."" Why to use bnb Travel is one of my loves in life, and I think that AirBnB is one of the best options to do it. For me a trip is not to travel somewhere and take some pictures.

This particular hummingbird decided it would do something. It swooped into the stream and picked up a few drops of water and went into the forest and put them on the fire. Then it went back to the stream and did it again, and it kept going back, again and again and again. All the other animals watched in disbelief; some tried to discourage the hummingbird with comments like, ""Don't bother, it is too much, you are too little, your wings will burn, your beak is too tiny, it’s only a drop, you can't put out this fire."" And as the animals stood around disparaging the little bird’s efforts, the bird noticed how hopeless and forlorn they looked. Then one of the animals shouted out and challenged the hummingbird in a mocking voice, ""What do you think you are doing?"" And the hummingbird, without wasting time or losing a beat, looked back and said, ""I am doing what I can."" Why to use bnb Travel is one of my loves in life, and I think that AirBnB is one of the best options to do it. For me a trip is not to travel somewhere and take some pictures. I want to know people, do the things people do where I travel and learn another ways of life!!

When we go to a city we love to stay in an apartment as opposed to a hotel. We like to get to know the local people and get local tips when we stay in a new place. One of our favorite destinations was Guatemala where we were immersed in the traditions and foods of the local people. We love our food, love good wines, good company and are both competent cooks. I love to finish a good meal with 4 drinks in front of me: a tasty wine, a quality water, an after dinner liqueur and an espresso - bliss!! We like to collect art and antiques and dabble in a bit of furniture restoration and renovation. We used to go out frequently but are now older (maybe not wiser) and spend time now on other pursuits - walking, foraging, furniture restoration, traveling, playing bridge (is that sad?!). Life motto? So many.... Live for the day Seize the moment One mans rubbish is another mans treasure (I like to recycle!)
