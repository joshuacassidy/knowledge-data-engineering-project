43881314,2020-08-03,2,187536638,Eimear,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Westport - the chalet was in a perfect location for us and the facilities were ideal. On a busy bank holiday weekend the area was full of fellow tourists and when we struggled to get a restaurant booking we got takeaway pizza in a place recommended by Darren, sat in front of our turf fire and opened a bottle of wine! On arrival Darren called the local pub and not only got us a last minute table but also dropped us down.The icing on the cake for me was my souvenir turf to recreate once back in Dublin!! "
43881314,2020-08-07,3,25298057,Ann,We had a great stay at Darren and Aoife’s - a great launchpad for cycling and walking the beautiful area.
43881314,2020-08-19,4,31196919,Emma,"Can’t recommend staying here enough! It’s the perfect base in a great location.. short walk to the harbour and a quick drive to Westport town. Beaches, surfing, restaurants all on your doorstep!Darren & Aoife were awesome hosts for the week.. so many tips on where to go, things to do, where to eat & drink. The chalet was spotless (we’re kinda nervous with everything going on right now), and we felt safe & at home straight away.We had an absolute ball from start to finish!"
43881314,2020-08-23,5,187088823,Justin,Lovely place a short (and very nice) walk from the Quays. Fireplace and board games have the place a really cozy feeling.
43830785,2020-09-19,6,365758837,Suzanne,"My partner & I, along with our fur baby Jess, have just returned from a wonderful week staying in Cates Farmhouse. Cate is so warm and welcoming and gave us a lovely welcoming basket of little treats. Her home is cosy and comfortable and has everything you need for a self catering holiday. It's a beautiful, peaceful, location with all the amenities you need just a short drive away. We will definitely be booking the big green farmhouse again."
8005634,2015-12-16,7,18313302,Benjamin,The host canceled this reservation 88 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8005634,2016-01-02,8,44746177,Eris,"Had an awesome stay in Dublin thanks to our great host! Bart was more than welcoming and went out of his way to show us the best of Dublin for New Year's Eve. The description of the room is accurate, very comfortable, and in a great location. Highly recommend! "
8005634,2016-01-23,9,49104106,Louis,"Bartosz est vraiment un hôte génial. Il m'a très bien accueilli. Il m'a permit d'être directement à l'aise dans un endroit nouveau pour moi. L'appartement est très bien situé dans le centre ville. L'appartement en lui même est comme sur les photos. La chambre est spacieuse et une commode ainsi qu'une penderie sont mises à disposition. Elle est très bien agencée et très confortableBartosz m'a également aidé dans ma recherche d'emploi, ce que ne font pas tous les hôtes.Recommande très fortement"
8005634,2016-02-21,10,54306084,Sébastien,"Bartosz was for me the perfect host, he was kind, friendly and tidy ! The room is very large and fully equiped, everything you can need is available ! And the location of the flat is perfect, and the place is quiet although it is just 50 meters from O'Connel street ! I really recommand this room because you can't find a better one for that price ! And the polish hospitality worths it !"
8005634,2016-03-08,11,24415177,Michelle,"Words fail to describe how kind-hearted, genuine, engaging, charismatic and phenomenal Bart is. He went above and beyond my expectations, making my stay a pleasant one. His flat is conveniently  located by the spire and accessible to the city at large. The bed was comfy and the comforter, warm. The flat itself is compact yet it meets the needs of any traveler. A bathroom and access to the kitchen. Wifi and towels available. I thoroughly recommend staying with Bart. He is also helpful in suggesting sights to see and things to do while in town."
8005634,2016-03-13,12,50216401,Bonnie,"Unfortunately, we were notified a couple weeks prior to our arrival that repairs were being done on the apartment the weekend we had booked. However, BK contacted us and let us know that he had already booked us alternative accommodations that was more centrally. He also bought us a voucher for dinner and tour bus tickets for the inconvenience. So while I can't say much about the actual aparment, BK was great about responding to my questions and giving us instructions on how to get from the airport to city center."
8005634,2016-03-26,13,33766253,Jesús,"We were at Bartek’s home in Dublin several days. He greeted us and tried at all times we were comfortable and we did not lack anything. We had drinks ready on arrival and when we checked out of escursion prepared sandwiches for the road. The room was spacious, comfortable and quiet. We could have the kitchen to our liking. At all times he was concerned that we not missing anything. The apartment is perfectly located just minutes from downtown, walking. If the bathroom and kitchen were a little more modern, it would be a totally perfect apartment. Thank you very much for everything, Bartek."
8005634,2016-04-04,14,20667027,Guillermo,"Wow...where can I start. All was positive. Bart is one of the kindest people I've ever met. Very helpful and communicative. He provided us great company, food (yes, food!), and a pleasant stay. You won't go wrong staying at Bart's flat. It's centrally located, close to everything, and in a very nice & quiet area. "
8005634,2016-04-11,15,59958658,Easton,"Great location for folks looking to see and enjoy Dublin. Right off of O'Connell Street near bus tours, pubs, restaurants and everything you would need to enjoy your stay. Bart, our host, was excellent - made us feel welcome, gave us tips to enjoy the city and even bought us a Guinness for a true welcome to Ireland! Highly recommend staying here!"
8005634,2016-05-08,16,42762216,Laura,"B mi ha accolto come meglio puo' desiderare un'ospite, gentile premuroso ha facilitato l'arrivo alla sua casa venendomi in contro sulla strada principale. Mi ha dato tutte le indicazioni possibili per visitare al meglio la  citta'. La casa e' ordinata,pulita, accogliente e perfettamente organizzata. Ho trovato un frigo pieno di tutto quello che serve per fare una buona colazione e B mi ha fatto trovare un bel cesto di frutta fresca e delle ottime piccole torte salate. La stanza  ha un comodo letto spazioso con una bella vista sui tetti di Dublino. La casa e' molto vicina al centro e ben servita dai mezzi pubblici. Consiglio vivamente a tutti i viaggiatori la casa di B.Laura."
8005634,2016-05-20,17,23001142,Cara,"I had a great stay with Bart. He went above and beyond the call of duty to make me feel welcome during the stay! He was very flexible with check in time, and came to meet me in the city and walk me to his apartment. The location is unbeatable, and good value for money considering its position close to Dublin's centre. Room is simple but has everything you need, plus some nice art on the walls. Bart had put out a lovely spread of fresh fruit, donuts, crisps, breakfast bars and beer/wine. Wow!!! Would definitely stay again if I was passing through Dublin."
8005634,2016-05-21,18,65073259,Eoin,"We had a great stay at Bart's place. He was a great host and couldn't be more helpful before & during our stay. He had food & drink for us when we arrived, the room was more than adequate for our stay, the location was perfect - close to all the main parts of Dublin. Would definitely recommend to everyone  "
8005634,2016-06-03,19,12048830,Kelly,Bart was a fantastic host. I booked very last minute and he was very accommodating. His flat is easy to find and he gives you all the essential information to access the building.He was there to meet me and provided snacks and drinks for me. The room is a good size with comfortable beds and big comforters.  I recommend anyone to stay here.Thanks B!
8005634,2016-06-04,20,5656802,Melissa,"Wonderful stay!  Our host was so welcoming, friendly, and beyond kind and thoughtful.  The room was very comfortable, and the location was excellent.  Highly recommended!"
8005634,2016-06-07,21,68451106,Michael,"Bart was very hospitable and friendly. He went out of his way to make me feel at home, and he was quite flexible with my schedule. The bed was comfortable and the WiFi worked great. The apartment is really close to the Temple Bar area and all of the major sights in town. I walked everywhere. I would definitely recommend Bart's place when you stay in Dublin."
8005634,2016-06-14,22,32705515,Kal,"Bart is an awesome host! From initial communication, greeting and throughout the stay. Bart made sure I was ok and was more than generous with food and drink!!"
8005634,2016-06-19,23,76319494,Callum,"We had an excellent stay, the room is in a brilliant location very close to O'Connel street in the city centre. The host was great and even provided us with beer, wine and some local food!  Bart was very friendly and provided us with some great advice on places to go and local specialties. Would definitely stay again next time we're in Dublin! "
8005634,2016-06-20,24,74763629,Trent,Great location in the heart of Dublin. Host was more than welcoming and even provided me with food after a long day of traveling. I highly recommend staying here!
8005634,2016-06-23,25,76319494,Callum,"Another excellent stay at Bart's! Again, great advice for local places to go.  He even was very flexible with the check out time, so that I could check out just before my flight. Would definitely recommend staying at Bart's place!"
8005634,2016-07-02,26,50732516,Aries,Location is great. You are just steps away from the iconic Spire of Dublin. Bart attempts hospitality to his guest. Had booked AirBnb many times but this is the first time staying with host. Prefer booking entire house. Room size is ok for 2 person. Bring your own towels and hair dryer. Bathroom is minimum cleanliness. We were out of WIFI for 2 days and hotwater for 1 day. There isnt many options for accomodation around Dublin. Ok for short stay. Ideal for male travelers. 
8005634,2016-07-02,27,69673180,Pam,Bart was very accommodating.  He was understanding of our early arrival time and allowed us to get in earlier than expected. He was also extremely generous with having food for us - totally unexpected and a very nice surprise.  The location is centrally located and within walking distance to Temple Bar.
8005634,2016-07-05,28,27443085,Sylvia,"B is a friendly and nice host. His place is neat and very convinience, close to city centre and lots of pub, restaurant and supermarket.I would recomment B's place if you are going to visit Dublin."
8005634,2016-07-19,29,2108419,Steven,"B was an excellent host.  He went out of his way to make sure I felt welcomed and he was very responsive to any questions I had.  He's also very friendly and helpful.  The location is ideal, too, and the room is comfortable. "
8005634,2016-08-01,30,18057113,Marek,"Bartek is a great guy, very enthousiastic and extremely friendly. He made us feel welcome (without being intrusive) in his apartment, even got us some sandwiches for breakfast the first morning.The apartment itself is fine (if you don't mind not having your own), the private room and beds are good, the location is great."
8005634,2016-08-13,31,40976216,Rachael,"B was very responsive as a host! He made sure we were able to get a key as soon as we arrived and was very communicative throughout the entire process. The apartment was very clean and our room was nicer than we had anticipated! Overall, it was a terrific way to end our two week trip in Ireland!"
8005634,2016-09-03,32,6876250,Naman,"Fantastic location near the Spire, easy to get to from the airport. Good size room with two full size beds. "
8005634,2016-09-06,33,55273202,Dan,"B was awesome! What a genuine and relatable host! He pointed us in the right direction, gave us advice and made us feel right at home. Great location to the center of everything. Highly recommend a stay here if you visit Dublin as you will make new friends!"
8005634,2016-09-09,34,75020332,Veronica,This was a great place to stay! Bartek went above and beyond to make my brother and I feel welcome and comfortable. He had food and drinks for us and even bought us bus tickets and coffee since we had to meet him at his work to pick up the keys. He was always available to answer questions and truly made the stay in Dublin that much more enjoyable! I would most definitely stay there again! Thanks B!
8005634,2016-09-17,35,79979458,Karl,Der Gastgeber war sehr freundlich und immer bemüht alle Wünsche zu erfüllen. Gerne werde ich immer wieder dort buchen und kann es nur empfehlen.
8005634,2016-09-25,36,93871446,Daniel,Perfekt. Clean. Friendly. Good located. Thx. B.
8005634,2016-10-03,37,48083853,Lorelei,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was a great introduction! Bart was in constant contact and helped me when I became a bit lost. He checked on me to assure everything was fine but did not intrude...I had the place to myself. The apartment was clean, well equipped and secure (important to me as a woman traveling alone. The location was the best, central to EVERY THING. Thank you, Bart, for making my vacation that much better!"
8005634,2016-10-15,38,85988059,예나,전날 밤에 예약했는데 빠르게 연락되었다. 더블침대가 두개있어서 네명이 잘 수 있는 방이라 혼자 사용하기엔 많이 컸다. 침대가 편하고 아늑하며 호스트는 아주 친절했고 편하게 지낼 수 있게 해줬다. 과일과 샌드위치는 맛있게 먹었다. 한밤 중에 걸어가기에 위치가 좋고 주변이 시끄럽지 않다. ^ㅇ^
8005634,2016-10-17,39,1920618,Carolyn,Great location in Dublin! Room is cozy. Host is friendly! He allowed us to store some bags while we traveled outside Dublin for a few days. 
8005634,2016-10-19,40,51927528,Ariel,"Nice place, great location, very accommodating and communicative host! Thank you so much!"
8005634,2016-10-22,41,1920618,Carolyn,This was our second time staying here; we began our trip at Bartek's flat and ended it there as well. He kept our luggage for us while we went traveling outside Dublin. He was flexible with our checkin--we were able to meet him at his workplace to collect the keys earlier in the day. He left some beer and sandwiches for us as well. Very friendly! 
8005634,2016-10-24,42,97382089,Jade,"Great stay at Barts! Got lost on arrival and he came and got us which was great. In our room was some Guinness and munchies which was more than welcoming and Bart is a chatty wee guy so we get right at home. Although we were out and about most of the weekend he was always chatty and recommended some great places to visit.Overall we would definitely return to stay and the fact our flight was later and Bart allowed us to stay late was a godsend as we were hungover as hell haha! Thanks again laddy, you're a wee legend!! "
8005634,2016-10-30,43,98833533,Erin,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I couldn't have been luckier. B kept in touch with us before and after my stay. He directed us from the airport to where we could find him to retrieve the keys. He let us checkout at our leisure. He bought us welcome bread and beer. The rooms were clean and the beds cozy. He has the mentality that guests should be treated like family, and it showed. The location is one street away from the central buzz of Dublin, yet his street is dead quiet (and so safe)! Amazing. Couldn't be a better location. I would love to live there myself. Confession Box Pub is a 2 minute walk and is a must-go. Book now!"
8005634,2016-11-12,44,14664394,Junghyun,It was perfect stay.  Thanks
8005634,2016-11-15,45,98924253,Simone,Thank you for all B . Is Not common found a person like you. Thanks for your time and your hospitality are really glad to have met you.
8005634,2016-11-21,46,53843308,Paulien,Toplocatie in een veilige buurt.Alles op loopafstand.Winkelstraat om de hoek.De wijk tempelbar op loopafstand.Bartek is een superfijne vent die alles eraan doet om het naar je zin te maken.
8005634,2016-12-10,47,101330849,Ka Wai,Bart is a very friendly and nice person! His place is comfy and clean. My friend and I really enjoyed our stay in his place! 
8005634,2016-12-11,48,15591288,Cathy,"Great location. There were two comfortable double beds in the room. Host bought sandwiches the evening arrived - nice thought, but we had dinner plans and I don't eat meat. Sandwiches were gone that night so we had no breakfast options."
8005634,2016-12-18,49,43384310,Catherine,Bartek is very very nice and he knows so well how to welcome people. He is the perfect host. The apartment is perfectly situated and quiet. 
8005634,2017-02-01,50,110067158,Luka,Great accommodation!
8005634,2017-02-01,51,52419818,Paul,The host canceled this reservation 51 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8005634,2017-02-19,52,41151126,Claudio,"B has been the best host I ever had.The house is in the city center, very clean and confortable. B is a very kind person and I will definitely be his guest if again in Dublin."
8005634,2017-02-27,53,103423170,Christa,"Die Lage der Wohnung war perfekt - im Herzen der Stadt, nur wenige Minuten vom ""Finger"" entfernt. B. war sehr freundlich, zuvorkommnend und hilfsbereit, kaufte extra Sandwiches, Obst und Wein für uns und gab wertvolle Tipps! Klasse war, dass er uns vom Flughafenbus abholte und so das Ankommen in einer fremden Stadt wesentlich erleichterte! Herzlichen Dank nochmal! Prädikat: Sehr empfehlenswert!"
44306122,2020-08-14,54,8338542,Julien,"My stay was really great, so many places around like restaurants, pubs have been recommended to me and I had a lovely time there."
8005634,2017-04-01,55,10274950,Man Kei Carol,B was great and welcome us even though we arrived quite late. He had also prepared us sandwiches and wine. A lovely place to stay at!
8005634,2017-04-04,56,119523863,Isabelle,"B's place was so perfect for us, two on-the-move college students. Communication was excellent and he even went out of his way to provide great snacks and good tips about local activities for us. The place is a little difficult to find, but it's a very short walk from Temple Bar/Trinity, as well as many bus stops and other tourist attractions. Comfortable for two people, but more than that would be slightly cramped."
8005634,2017-04-09,57,14147161,Anna,"I had a very nice stay at B.'s place. It's quiet and central at the same time. B. is friendly, easy, helpful, everything to make it easy for his guests ! Thanks again :)"
8005634,2017-04-13,58,71603391,Luko,"B's place is conveniently placed for all your Dublin needs, including O'Connell shopping and Temple Bar strolling. Apartment also has a great connection (3 mins walk) to airport 747 bus services. All of these makes a stay at B's apartment very enjoyable, but the crowning glory is certainly the host himself whose hospitality is second to none. Whether you are taking a weekend or week long Dublin break, B will make sure that your stay is comfortable and that you feel right at home. If there are a yearly nominations for the best Airbnb host, B would surely win the gold medal. All the best for the future, L & G"
8005634,2017-04-18,59,188309,Florian,"A truly great experience. Bart was very welcoming and super nice. He really made sure that we were comfortable from the start! Communication was nearly instant. Truly a experienced airbnb'er and super nice guy (no exaggeration)!The apartment itself is also a very good beginning point to explore the city. Super central with walking distances to the river, temple bar, trinity college and basically every other main attraction. Also only a couple of minutes away from the airport bus, so transfer was a breeze. Big recommendation for Bart and his place for a trip to experience Dublin. We even went for a daytrip to Belfast, which was also very easy to do, thanks to the local bus system (15 mins footwalk to long-distance-busses from the appartement).Thanks again and hope to see you soon!Cheers!"
8005634,2017-04-29,60,119861548,Nicole,"This AIR BNB was great. First time renting a room instead of entire home. So glad we did it this way in Dublin. Our host was so welcoming, friendly and made us feel at home. Great location as well."
8005634,2017-05-08,61,118561214,Amisha,"Excellent place to stay and the location is perfect. B was a great host to stay with, extremely friendly and he knew the best spots to go to. I would definitely recommend staying here. "
8005634,2017-05-14,62,1764942,Maïa,"Bartosz is a great host! We met him at his work to get the keys, he was very nice and explained exactly how to get to his place where sandwiches and fruits were expecting us :) The location of the apartment is perfect, we went everywhere walking (it's and so very easy to get there from the airport)! I would definitely recommend this room :)"
8005634,2017-05-22,63,1397497,Lisa,"Bart's place is centrally located right by the Spire. Especially if you choose to take any Paddywagon tours, one of the departure points is a few steps away. Dublin isn't that big a city, so you can easily walk to most of the main sites. Bart was an exceptional host. He met us at the bus stop to walk with us back to the flat, and also supplied us with lots of fruits and breakfast items which you typically don't expect from Airbnb hosts. He even had sandwiches for us since he knew we were going on a tour first thing int he morning to bring with us!"
8005634,2017-05-27,64,54717152,Lucy,"Good location and good sized double room, with fresh bedding & towels and plenty of fruit and drinks included - even sandwiches available on arrival!Excellent communication from the host, who replied to messages within minutes and was extremely eager to please."
8005634,2017-05-28,65,46849336,Zack,"Bart's place is near and within walking distance to everything we needed. The building felt secure: code for the outer gate, key to the 1st building door and another coded interior door. Bart was a super host and has a great energy.He had snacks and coffee for us, and offered up dinner and bar suggestions. Positive experience after jet lag and a sleepless flight."
8005634,2017-06-04,66,47151815,Danielle,"You have to stay with B!I booked this trip to Ireland with my mother who has not been out of the country in almost 30 years! So I was nervous booking a single room instead of an entire place, but I could not pass up the location, the other reviews, and the price/value of his apartment. Neither of us were disappointed in the least.The accommodations are just as they are shown and described, B was very inviting and made sure we had all that we needed when we arrived. Before, during and after our stay, B was very responsive to any questions, suggestions, or concerns. It is a very safe and quite neighborhood but also minutes from everywhere you want to. He was also very accommodating by letting us check in early since our plane arrived at 8am. On our last day he bought us sandwiches and coffee for our train ride to Cork. I've traveled all over the world and stayed in numerous AirBnb's, B is by far the best host I have ever met and worked with. Besides the apartment, I very much enjoyed staying on the ""north"" side. Every day it was a quick bus/train/trolley to wherever we were headed. Temple Bar is a must on a Friday/Saturday night! The churches are pretty, Jameson distillery is nice even if you don't do the tour, Dublin Castle and Trinity College are good to check out too."
8005634,2017-06-06,67,125268669,Melissa,Bart was an amazing host! He made us feel at home! The room was great and the beds were very nice! He even provided snacks and food which we greatly appreciated. If you have the opportunity you should definitely stay with him. He is so friendly and gave us great advice on places to go to in Dublin. It was a great experience to stay with him. 
8005634,2017-06-10,68,96867017,Tomasz,B is a very personable and tries hard to please guests.Location is very good.
8005634,2017-06-12,69,11927493,Jon,"B es un gran anfitrión y ha hecho que nuestros días en Dublín sean pefectos. Nos ha provisto de todo lo que necesitábamos, nos ha dado buenos consejos y ha atendido nuestras llamadas y mensajes al momento. La habitación como en la foto y las zonas comunes tambié. bien. Ubicación excelente.  Inmejorable"
8005634,2017-06-15,70,58816539,Tianmu,This place is great! It is very central in Dublin. The room is very clean. My host is very kind and helpful. He definitely show me Irish hospitality as my first host in Ireland.
8005634,2017-06-18,71,129120172,Renato,"Fiquei em casa do B. com a minha esposa por três noites. A localização do apartamento é excelente. Zona tranquila, principalmente residencial, a 5 minutos a pé de distância do centro. B. é muito simpático e foi um anfitrião muito acima das nossas expectativas. Tratamento de fazer inveja a muitos hotéis de 5 estrelas!!"
8005634,2017-06-21,72,41917560,Nicole,Great accommodation for our stay! 
8005634,2017-06-26,73,15119079,Nicole,"This is an excellent place. B was super great at communicating the location, which was very easy to navigate from on our visits around the city. Very close to a main bus stop, so easy to get around, but almost every thing we did was walking distance (Temple Bar, Trinity College, museums, Grafton Street). Super clean. Nothing bad to say! "
8005634,2017-06-30,74,43794716,Connie,"Bart was a great host! He had sandwiches for us from a local bakery and encouraged us to help ourselves to anything in the kitchen. We had access to our bedroom, and the shared bathroom and kitchen. The bedroom and beds were comfortable (free Netflix!), the bathroom could use some updating. It's a small apartment but if you're just looking for a cozy place to sleep in a great location, this is the place! Short walk to restaurants and transportation, including the tour buses. It's only about a 20 minute walk to Trinity College, St. Stephen's Green and others. I liked that the apartment was set back a ways from the street so there wasn't much traffic noise. I recommend it!"
8005634,2017-07-05,75,115230043,Scott,"Bart is super helpful and extremely friendly and goes out of his way to make sure you feel at home. We had a very early flight and we had some trouble getting in to his place at first. But even though he had a half marathon he was running that same day, he let us go right there and helped us get in. On top of that, Bart's place is minutes away from anything you want in Dublin. If you love history you can visit many historical sites all between 5 and 15 minutes of walking. There are many great pubs and places to eat nearby but if you're set on Temple Bar you're still only 10 minutes away. If you like tours that bring you around Dublin or other destinations in Ireland, many of those services are only 5 minutes away. It's a great location and he is a great host. I highly recommend anyone coming to Dublin to stay with him! "
8005634,2017-07-07,76,24482028,Sarah,Perfect spot to stay while in Dublin! Bart is a very welcoming and generous host. The apartment will meet all your needs and the location is perfect for sightseeing while still be quiet for sleeping. I would highly recommend!
8005634,2017-07-10,77,2137484,Lauren,Bart was great. Super friendly and accommodating and gave us great recommendations for places to go. It's a good location. Really walkable. I'd stay here again 
8005634,2017-07-16,78,81831733,Jan,"B is a great host. We were greeted not only with his enthusiasm and friendliness but also food and drinks. Great location on a quiet street and walking distance to most of the Dublin attractions. Across the street is one of the best pubs in Dublin ""The Confession Box"". A must for a cool Guinness and life music."
8005634,2017-07-20,79,2995217,Donna,Centrally located near some of the best restaurants and pubs. Tour bus pick up point was very close which I liked. Tourist sites were just a short walk. B was very helpful and prompt with communication. He was also generous in leaving snacks and water after a long day. Would stay again. 
8005634,2017-07-22,80,1016320,Gary,"Bart was an amazing host! He's super friendly, easy to talk to, and he went above and beyond what most hosts would do. I stayed two nights and would recommend this place. It's very close to everything. Literally in the heart of the city but it's still secluded and quiet because the building is away from the streets and has its own courtyard. It's a great value too."
8005634,2017-07-23,81,111087658,Keith,Comfortable accommodation in a great location with a lovely host - can't want for more than that! B provided unexpected extras and was great at communication and providing tips - the stay was ideal for us.
8005634,2017-07-26,82,129473724,Roya,"We had a fantastic stay here in Dublin. The place is centrally located, which made walking everywhere easy. Bart is a wonderful host who thought of everything. Would highly recommend."
8005634,2017-08-01,83,16136921,Genevieve,"Bart is the true definition of a gentleman. I had a few days alone in Dublin and he made me feel comfortable. He gave me perfect instructions and picked me up at the train stop to help me with my bags. He also helped me pick out running routes, day trips, restaurants, printing shops for my boarding pass, etc. I was exhausted from my travels and needed these days to recuperate and this room provided me privacy, space, quiet time and NETFLIX!! But it was also very central to any buses or trains and restaurants for any activities. Bart set me up with loads of fruit, breads and cookies. He came home one night with several sandwiches to choose from and chocolates that he was prepared to share. The room, kitchen and bathroom were clean, comfortable and the whole stay was affordable. I would certainly come back again to stay at Bart's!"
8005634,2017-08-06,84,63799624,Tami,B was so nice! Staying at his place was a great time! Amazing location and very cozy room! B got us free tickets to tours and museums and was very helpful! Would 100% recommend!
8005634,2017-08-09,85,135266564,Anita,Such a welcoming and friendly host...easy going and always with a smile on his face.Really good location.Thanks for everything! :)
8005634,2017-08-14,86,40738234,Emil,Perfekt läge mitt i Dublin! Väldigt god gästvänlighet från B och hans mamma!
8005634,2017-08-17,87,52241533,Suzanne,"B's apartment is in a terrific location -- the Abbey Theatre is right down the street. And B is very sweet. The room is a bit cramped, and the apartment is shared with B's parents. His mother was very welcoming."
8005634,2017-09-07,88,103803047,Tomas,"Bart was one of the best hosts in Airbnb I ever was. Clean and nice room, but more importantly personal and friendly approach. Felt like being home."
8005634,2017-09-24,89,116105620,Erwin,"Bart is een goede host die echt zijn best doet om het jou naar je zin te maken. En een heerlijk rustige ligging in het midden van de stad, ideaal!"
8005634,2017-10-10,90,4911319,Ellen,"Bart and his mom were extremely sweet! He was very accommodating and had little snacks and food for me around the house. The place is super close to everything, so you can walk everywhere. Would definitely stay here again without question."
8005634,2017-12-21,91,142361893,Antonia,"Bart was very welcoming and friendly, as well as his Mom. The flat was tidy, but the bathroom is rather old and could use a renovation. The flat is in an apartment complex off the street, so it is quiet. The newly opened Luas stops just down the street."
8005634,2018-01-01,92,110192083,Gaëlle,Emplacement au top. Proche de l'artère principale de la ville mais une rue en parallèle donc aucun problème pour la tranquillité. Proche de Temple bar en 10min on y est.Bart est vraiment un hôte parfait! Il nous a donné des adresses utiles et nous étions comme chez nous chez lui.
8005634,2018-01-08,93,33193640,Michelle,"Bart ist ein unglaublich toller Gastgeber,er war sehr freundlich, hat uns (meine Mutter uns mich) immer wieder mit kleinen Snacks überrascht und uns reichlich mit Tipps versorgt.Das Appartment hat eine fantastische Lage, man ist direkt in der Innenstadt Und hat eine gute Verkehrsanbindung (Tram, Busse und Zug in 1 bis max. 6 Min zu erreichen).Bart hat uns zum schicken Abendessen die Brasserie Sixty6 empfohlen, es war traumhaft! Der Pub namens Confession Box in der Nähe von Appartment ist ein Muss! Tolle Menschen.Jedem ist diese Unterkunft mit Bart als Gastgeber wärmstens zu empfehlen (wenn man rein Sauberkeitsniveau eines Hotels erwartet) :)))Vielen Dank, wir haben die Zeit sehr genossen!"
8005634,2018-01-19,94,167737656,Jon,"Bart is a fantastic host. Lots of really nice touches - fresh fruit, bottled water, sandwiches ,wine, Dublin activity passes, etc. Very walkable location."
8005634,2018-02-01,95,125541449,Monique,"Un accueil formidable! Et un super rapport qualité/prix. Bart fait tout pour que ce soit parfait, grande gentillesse. De plus l'emplacement est exceptionnel, près de tout ce qu'il y a à voir ou à faire à Dublin, bus et tramway pas loin et en plus c'est un endroit calme."
8005634,2018-02-04,96,121657383,Naikee,"Had an amazing stay in Dublin at Bart's place. The location was very central, and Bart is a very welcoming host. I would definitely recommend!"
8005634,2018-02-12,97,54675455,Hayley,"Bart was by far the most accommodating and sweetest host that I've ever had the pleasure of booking with. Not only was his place spotless, but he went out of his way to buy us snacks and give us plenty of recommendations to fulfill our stay. Bart helped make our trip memorable and is a dear friend after this experience! Everyone should stay here!"
8005634,2018-02-16,98,138926383,Shammai,"Bart's room is exactly as described! He's an excellent host, greeted me on arrival, showed me around and made it feel like a home away from home. He offered many insightful tips of Dublin and where I could go. The room is located in a fantastic central location, bus and tram services on your doorstep. You also have access to the kitchen."
8005634,2018-02-25,99,132937406,Inger,"Hyggelig rom i en privat leilighet. vi hadde tilgang til det vi trengt av kjøkken og bad.  Vert som gjorde alt for at vi skulle trives og ikke mangle noe.  Lett å finne frem og veldig sentralt, gangavstand til det meste.Kan anbefales."
8005634,2018-03-09,100,176526839,Paddy,Excellent host. Great location safe and easy to find.
8005634,2018-03-13,101,7990595,Trisha,Very comfortable bed and great location. Very good value for a one night visit to Dublin.
8005634,2018-04-01,102,85277529,Armelle,Un hôte d'une remarquable gentillesse et surtout toujours avec le sourire!Logement remarquablement bien placé.
8005634,2018-04-07,103,168138441,Emily,"Bart was a great host, and we are so glad that we stayed in his apartment for our week in Ireland. The location is unbeatable, and you can walk to all major points of interest. It’s also super close to all forms of public transportation on O’Connell Street. We loved having two double beds and despite the close proximity to everything, it’s quiet in the apartment. Bart and his mom (you’ll share the apartment with her!) were both sweet and helpful. We were out and about so we weren’t in the apartment much, but it was nice to have Netflix to unwind after a long day of walking and sightseeing. Also, there is a washer you can use, but no dryer, so just plan to air dry your clothes. Thanks again for everything, Bart!! We hope to stay with you in Dublin again! Slainte!"
8005634,2018-04-09,104,129642755,Cate,Bart and his mother were very friendly and the apartment was located perfectly for getting to the meeting place for a tour bus I needed to catch. Thanks again!
8005634,2018-04-13,105,171209039,Nathan,"Great place to stay. Right near a main street but not directly on it so it's peaceful. Bart gave great tips of places to go, the sight seeing bus has a great deal to go seeing great places and get around town. 50 euros and you get a 2day bus ticket and a fast track ticket to the Guinness store house. Overall one of my favorite Airbnb places I've ever stayed through my entire trip in Europe. Definitely worth it!"
8005634,2018-04-21,106,98952186,Marc,"Bart was a really nice and helpfull host for his his nice cozy room.From a well-furnished room, great advices where to go to from on the first night, to descretion and a treatment à la ""mi casa es su casa"" (fridgge for full usage and a prepared fruit basket), Bart really took care of us and made our stay really good.Thanks mate :-)"
8005634,2018-05-04,107,30472494,Afton,Bart was a great host. The room was spacious and clean. It was close to the Spire and was easy to find. Be sure to take the time to talk with Bart and his mom. Lovely people!

8005634,2018-05-12,110,2301201,Mario,Bart and his mother were excellent hosts! They went beyond our basic needs to ensure that we had a great stay! The location of this flat is great! Just a short walk to the Temple Bar area! Would highly recommend.
8005634,2018-05-14,111,92044062,Olivier,"Nice room in a flat located near all the transports (the two tram lines and the airport bus). Very close to the city centre. Bart provide us some food ans drinks. Very friendly person, as much as his mother. Confortable bed. I recommand it."

8005634,2018-06-13,114,102283114,Megan,"Stayed with a friend at Bart’s place and loved our time there! Bart is an incredible host with a wealth of knowledge of the city. He gave us lots of tips for places to go and went out of his way to help us enjoy our time in Dublin. The room was comfortable, clean, and he even provided snacks for our stay! Would definitely stay with him again next time in Dublin!"
8005634,2018-07-06,115,23399698,Elisa,"Bart was one of the best hosts I've ever had. The hospitality, great tips, great location ... I had a great time and a wonderful stay!"
8005634,2018-07-08,116,32299357,Dan,Bert was a fantastic host and made me feel right at home from the start. The accommodation is basic but clean and in a fantastic location. I’d stay here again any time I’m in Dublin.
8005634,2018-07-11,117,199471889,Dāvis,brilliant place where to stay!
8005634,2018-07-15,118,93596794,André,"Check in was very uncomplicated and we appreciated the hospitality. Thanks for the doughnuts! :) The apartment itself was quite small and thus looked a little bit different in real life compared to the online pictures unfortunately. On top of that, it was quite expensive compared to another apartment we stayed in. However, all in all we have had a good stay :)"
8005634,2018-07-16,119,111719270,Dineo,Great centrally- located apartment in an ideal location for city travelers. Will definitely book it again in the future.
8005634,2018-07-19,120,176461356,Beth,"Bart’s place is super convenient to O’Connell street. We could walk there in minutes and have access to all forms of public transportation. The place is small and we shared a bathroom with his mom, which I didn’t expect. She was very accommodating however and she and Bart provided us with some food for breakfast and lunch. Can’t beat the location!"
8005634,2018-08-23,121,54850075,Karissa,"Bart's apartment is literally right next to the Spire on O'Connell street which was excellent for us to get back and forth when we were shopping and after work for the day. He had great suggestions on where to go and things to see on our days off of work. When trying to find the apartment, make sure that you walk down the street for at least 2 -3 minutes. We were really confused since it didn't say how long we would be walking and we thought we had missed the apartment. Once you pass the street on your left with the Spire, you have just a few more feet to go :) "
8005634,2018-08-26,122,58277724,Jeonghwan,Good place in the City
8005634,2018-09-09,123,212877411,Aj,Amazing host! Worked with me when I was delayed coming into town.
8005634,2018-09-24,124,39727217,John,"Bart’s apartment is a short walk from the sights of Dublin, while still maintaining peace and quiet at night. After a long day of sightseeing, it was great to lay down and watch some Netflix. Would recommend for simple lodging!"
8005634,2018-09-27,125,105461395,Michael,"Bart’s place is wonderful. Close to city centre, restaurants, tourist spots and even grocery store. Will definitely recommend this place if anyone come to Dublin and looking for accommodation."

8005634,2018-11-07,132,2923691,Bart,"Room is not in o Connel Street, but in a parallel Street. Bartek is a friendly guy. He lives in the appartment with his mother. Bathroom is shared and small. Very secured place. You have to enter a code at the street-gate, a code at the main entrance and of course the key of the appartment."
8005634,2018-11-11,133,76157450,Pilar,"Great location,walking distance from everywhere.The house is really clean and cosy.2min walk from the airport shuttle bus stop.Bart is a lovely guy always Willing to help and very approchable."
8005634,2018-11-24,134,32749165,Dovilė,Bart's place is in the very city center. It is warm and cozy. Bart is very helpful and waited for us at the gate entrance - thank you a lot! :) The kitchen was extremely useful for us. And the shower was probably the best in the city (knowing how powerless they usually are). Thank you again! It was nice meeting you and your mother :)
8005634,2018-11-27,135,221646955,Teodora,"A perfect place to stay at, if you're going to Dublin. The location is central, so everything is in a walking distance. The room itself is comfortable, with 2 big beds. The whole flat, though small, provides all the necessities. And, not the least, the host is amazing, welcoming and super friendly! :)"
8005634,2018-12-03,136,222065055,Carol,"Bart is a great host and a lovely man. The location is fantastic but this apartment is shocking. Dated, dirty and cramped. Bathroom full of mould. Bath has a hole in the bottom held together with silicone. Kitchen small and dirty. No front on cooker. Divan bed has stains on it. Generally very dated and not worth what we paid for it"
8005634,2018-12-20,137,152056309,Felicia,"Bart is a lovely host! Incredibly friendly and eager to share advice on whatever you may be seeking in Dublin. The location is truly great, I would recommend this!"

8005634,2019-01-01,139,128114174,Daniel,"Friendly, approachable host with an apartment in the perfect location in central Dublin. Communication was clear and prompt, B was kind and offered to go out of his way for us. Would definitely recommend."
8005634,2019-01-07,140,224250980,Luz,"El espacio de B tiene una ubicación inmejorable pues está a una cuadra de la Avenida principal, todo queda cerca. Paradas de autobuses, el autobús para el aeropuerto y de tours especiales, restaurantes y tiendas. B. es muy amable y está siempre listo a ayudarte.  La habitación es pequeña para dos personas  pero tiene todo lo necesario. Una magnífica opción"
8005634,2019-01-15,141,119153971,Sierra,Bart is a wonderful host! He was so hospitable and easygoing. As soon as I arrived I felt at home and comfortable communicating with him. He also shared lots of information about the city and went above and beyond to make my stay special! Amazing experience!
8005634,2019-01-19,142,40881306,Chiara,"Die Lage der Wohnung ist einfach ideal! Bus, Mietwagenverleih, Stadtzentrum, Supermärkte, Pubs, Restaurants etc. sind innerhalb kürzester Zeit erreicht. Die Kommunikation mit Bart und das Check in liefen völlig problemlos. Bart ist ein sehr zuvorkommender und freundlicher Gastgeber, mit dem Tipp Howth hat er uns ein schönes Ausflugsziel beschert :) Die Wohnung ist nicht nagelneu / auf Hotelniveau, preisleistungstechnisch für jeden Airbnb-Nutzer für Ausflüge nach Dublin aber absolut empfehlenswert! Danke Bart!"
44306122,2020-08-21,143,201869467,Alex,Really easy going host. Nice place and nice people. Quick response and helps with anything needed. I didnt expect to feel so comfortable. I enjoyed it

8005634,2019-02-10,145,173193635,Aranzazu,"Emplacement idéale pour visiter Dublin, on peut tout faire à pied. En centre-ville mais dans une rue calme, pas de bruit la nuit. Pratique pour aller et venir de l'aeroport, arret de bus juste à coté."
8005634,2019-02-20,146,110500827,Guy,"Bart's place is well located for local amenities and a short walk over the river gets you to Temple Bar. It was also easy to locate from the 747 airport bus, with pick up back to the airport from O'Connoll Street. We ate in O'Shea's on Talbot Street a couple of times and the food was excellent. Likewise I would recommend The Celt, which is nearby - a bit more expensive but great food and atmosphere.The apartment is within a gated complex with a security door and hence felt very secure.Communication with Bart was good - I inadvertently text the wrong number on arrival but an arrangement for meeting Bart's friend at the flat was quickly arranged.Bart is a really nice chap. We didn't see a lot of him as we were in and out at different times, but when we did he was very welcoming, and interested in chatting and giving a perspective on Dublin. He was keen to encourage us to use the flat as our own and offered us wine etc.As Bart has noted elsewhere in feedback it's important to note that the listing was for a room in his flat, rather than the apartment itself, although there is access to the kitchen -  we knew this and had a good visitThank you Bart for your hospitality and good luck with the Barcelona Marathon!"

I love that there was also a space heater. The host was amazing and incredibly friendly, providing several tips and good conversation about his experience in his own travels.

The private bedroom was spacious and very comfortable. It is located in close walking distance to some great pubs (relatively close to Temple Bar). Bart was very helpful with recommendations of places to go. I would recommend  ordering the bangers and mash at Blannigan’s! Bottom-line, I would certainly stay here again."
8005634,2019-05-19,160,12448263,Jim,The hosts are very helpful and friendly. You will feel safe and right at home.  You will be very close to everything that Dublin has to offer.

It was our first time in Dublin and the location is excellent for walking to see the sights or taking public transportation anywhere. It was super quiet at night and the huge tv with Netflix was great to relax to after a long day walking around the city. The apartment is shared with the hosts mother and she is very kind and helpful. The host is super nice and gave us tons of recommendations that we used to see things in the city.

As long as you read the listing properly, you are fine.  It is truly an apartment that is shared.  Bart and his mother live there, but they are quiet and sharing the kitchen and bathroom was never a problem.  Bart is a generous and enthusiastic young man.  Such a fine host.  He made us feel very welcome indeed!"

Check-In und Out verliefen reibungslos ohne Probleme. Das Schlafsofa ist allerdings recht unbequem! Was man zusätzlich bedenken sollte ist, dass es sich hierbei nur um ein Zimmer handelt -> In der Wohnung selbst lebt noch die Mutter des Vermieters, welche aber sehr sehr freundlich war!"

Aoife was there to greet us and show us the room which is nice and cozy, and very clean. The room is equipped with a wardrobe which is great to store your things and put away your suitcases (as the room isn't big it's very practical). Aoife thought of leaving a couple of maps of the city and other useful indications which was nice. The wifi works perfectly. The place is also perfectly located. You can reach Grafton St in like 10min walk. And despite the fact it is right in the city centre it is really quiet.We would definitely try to stay there on our next visit to Dublin !"
10380625,2016-02-08,223,25988958,Viviana,Great hosts!The room's a little small but the location is very good
10380625,2016-02-09,224,25988958,Viviana,"Aoife and her boyfriend are nice and friendly; the location is very good (10-15 minutes walking to Temple Bar). The room is small, with a queen-size bed, we were two and we felt a little squeezed, but you have everything you need (hair drier, towels); you can't use the kitchen but you can make tea and coffee  in the room.

10380625,2016-02-21,226,39011650,Ida Amalie Bodh,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Aoife's for three nights. When we arrived both Aiofe and her boyfriend were at home and we felt immediately welcome. The apartment was really beautiful as was the room we got to stay in. The apartment is located in walking distance to the city center in a very quiet neighborhood. We didn't se much of Aiofe and her boyfriend the three days we stayed at their apartment, but on the first morning they had prepared homemade bread for us which tasted wonderful. All in all we were really happy to stay at Aiofe's. The only thing we have againt the room we stayed in is that the bed wasn't long enough for my boyfriend who is 1.85 cm high."
10380625,2016-02-27,227,56359377,Tom,"Ma petite amie et moi avons beaucoup aimé ce petit séjour de trois nuits chez Aoife.

Le quartier est calme bien qu'il soit bien situé (près de tous les sites incontournables de Dublin). Bouilloire, machine à café, fruits, serviettes de bains, shampoing, gel douche, sèche cheveux... sont à disposition, chose très appréciable. Je vous recommande vivement cet airb&b."

They even worked it out for us to be there right after another guest. The place felt a little further out than we were thinking, but still only a 15-20 minute walk to most places in the city centre - just felt long when we were tired. Overall, it was a great place to crash while exploring Dublin! "
10380625,2016-03-13,230,41934736,Pavla,"The place was just awesome! Great location, ideal if you want to explore the city centre. Even though it is in the centre you don't feel like that when you enter the little street where the place is located."

El departamento esta cerca de varios puntos turísticos y hay paradas de autobús e incluso el hop on-hop off súper cerca. Aoife fue muy amable y de hecho pude hacer el check-in más temprano lo cual fue de gran ayuda después de un viaje tan largo. El cuarto es excelente para una buena noche de descanso, ya que aunque esta cerca de puntos turísticos la calle es realmente tranquila y no hay ruido por las noches. Definitivamente lo recomiendo!"

10380625,2016-08-14,256,7269014,Simone,"We arrived a bit later than planned, so we didnt meet the host. However, Aoife left the keys for us, so we could check in anyway. The room is small, but fine, clean and it had clean towels and even shampoo! The room is better suitable for a couple than for friends, as the bed is quite small. The location is great, just outside touristic Dublin, close to an authentic pub (nothing like Temple Bar or so) and a 5-10 minute walk to a lot of great restaurants and touristic hotspots. We would definetly recommend this AirBnB if you are planning to go out and explore the city most of the time."

The high level of security for their building and comfortable living spaces make you feel safe and welcome, and the hosts really made it feel like home. "
10380625,2016-09-06,260,15923269,Christopher,"Stayed here for 3 nights with my girlfriend. The room was a little on the small side, but comfortable, clean and quiet. We're very happy we found Aoife's place. It was super convenient to everything. We walked everywhere. We would definitely recommend staying here if you are going to be out sightseeing all day. "
10380625,2016-10-08,261,24224922,Sarah,Aoife's place was perfect.  It was very easy to access everything in Dublin.  The location is very secure as well.  Her space is clean and very homey.  She was great with communication and helping us feel very welcomed in Dublin. 
10380625,2016-10-11,262,64934961,Lieke,"We had a nice stay here in Dublin. Location was great and it was really quiet. The bed was pretty small, so be aware of that when you book it."
10380625,2016-10-15,263,17417018,Miriam,"Ich hatte einen guten Aufenthalt bei Aoife. Die Wohnung liegt super zentral. Das Zimmer ist nicht groß, aber für 1,2,3 Nächte zum Erkunden der Stadt völlig  ausreichend. Aoife habe ich nur bei der Ankunft gesehen, sie hat mir alles gezeigt, sonst haben wir per SMS kommuniziert. Für einen kurzen Citytrip kann ich die Unterkunft für 1-2 Personen empfehlen.  "
10380625,2016-10-17,264,26007078,Amanda,Aoife was easy to work with and the property was accurately described 
10380625,2016-10-23,265,15881745,Clara,"The location is perfect, you can walk everywhere. Quiet zone next to a great area full of restaurants, live music and monuments like Saint Patricks cathedral. Also there is a bus close to the apartment that brings you directly to the Airport. Aoife is a really nice host and is always ready to give you all kind of information. We found the room enough comfortable for a weekend trip and everything was really clean.We will absolutely recommend it for a short trip in Dublin!"
10380625,2016-10-28,266,511941,Bandele,"Aoife’s place has what’s needed to stay away from home and it is very clean.  The room has a very comfortable double bed, cupboard and hangers for clothes, Iron and Ironing board, Multi Plug to power four things at the same time and a wall heater. And there is the kettle, cup and tea as well.  Loved the window you can open to get in fresh air.  Wi-Fi is strong all the time.Temple Bar is roughly a maximum 10 minute walk away and the Cathedral is just round the corner.  The financial district is a brisk 30 minute walk or 20 minutes by bus.  Good place to be near Dublin Old City but not in it.  I’ll surely stay again if Aoife’s place comes up in my search of a place to stay in Dublin."
10380625,2016-10-31,267,1507877,Loes,We had a nice welcome even though we arrived late in the evening.It's was a good stay and perfect location to visit Dublin.

The room is clean and comfortable.Aoife and Ross are very helpful and are great with communication and giving tips about Dublin.There is a bus stop  close to the apartment  from where you get direct buses to and from  the airport .We would definitely recommend staying here!!"
10380625,2016-11-16,270,61701941,Yujin,"I really loved the view from the window:) In the morning i woke up by chirping sounds of birds which was enjoyable too. Felt safe in the area. There is a bar right next to it. Pretty good place to grab a drink before going back to the room. Bed was comfortable, teas were good, and restroom also nice. Everything is in walking distance. Room and bathroom are well organized, clean. Nothing to complain about. Strongly recommend!"
10380625,2016-11-26,271,594546,Magda,"Aoife and Ross are very friendly and caring, indeed the perfect hosts. They gave us a warm welcome along with lots of tips  and suggestions. The room is  cosy, warm with a very comfy bed and a very clean bathroom. The location of the house cannot be better for someone who wants to explore the center of Dublin. Highly recommended place to stay !"
10380625,2016-11-29,272,103015325,Giorgia,"Really cute bedroom and very quiet . Great location, perfect for whoever wants to discover Dublin by foot!"
10380625,2016-12-18,273,46066445,Eloisa,Aoife was a great host! She was very kind to us and the room is exactly as advertised. The location is perfect. Nice area and everything is within walking distance. We would definitely stay here again! Thanks Aoife! 
10380625,2016-12-30,274,104831787,Jean-Carlos,I didn't spend too much time in the room (simply slept in it for two nights) but the room and bathroom were very clean and exactly as described.  The location is great and it is in a very secure location (requires multiple keys to get into).  The hosts were very helpful especially when my wife and I were rather late in checking in due to figuring out the public transit in the area.  Although the room is a bit small its great for having a nice place to sleep in the heart of the city. Couldn't be happier.  Thanks again guys.
10380625,2017-01-06,275,57183325,Stephanie,"Aoife and Ross were very nice and communicative before and during our stay.  We also were provided a french press, coffee, and two sets of clean towels during the week we were there. However, there were a few things that made this stay less than optimal, particularly as we were two guests.  The room itself is quite small, as is the bed.  The hot water isn't available at all times (I'm guessing a common occurrence in the city), but this made for some interesting mornings as four people were all trying to shower or use the bathroom.  However, I would recommend this for one person to stay; the location is great, a close walk to downtown, and the place itself is very secure.  "
10380625,2017-01-30,276,11935337,Mark,Aoife was very helpful and considerate . Highly recommend her lovely place which was so central and convenient .

Falls man doch mit dem Bus fahren möchte, fahren einige Buslinien nur 2 Minuten von der Wohnung entfernt ab. Aoifes Unterkunft war sehr sauber, sehr ruhig und gemütlich.

The bedroom and the bed  are quite small so it is a very good solution if you just need a place to sleep and ideally if you are travelling alone. All in all it was a good experience!"
10380625,2017-04-10,284,118872939,Anna,"Aofi's house is very well located, just a few minutes walking to the city center. She has a cozy house, clean and tidy. She has always been kind with us and helpful. I would recomend staying at her house. Thanks Aofi for everything,  Anna"

Hay paradas de autobús cerca, aunque te puedes mover a pie. Aoife nos aconsejó lugares para ver y sitios donde comer y se preocupó por nuestra hora de llegada para tenerlo todo preparado y recibirnos en su casa. Muy recomendable. "

10380625,2017-05-03,289,54235342,Spencer,"Aoife was very communicative and accommodating despite being away during the bank holiday in which we were staying. We got some good advice on food and attractions to check out. The apartment is nicely decorated and in a secure, safe area. We enjoyed walking back from Temple bar at the end of the evening to the peace and quiet (silent, actually, aside from occasional use of plumbing from other residents) for some good sleep. There is a view of St. Patrick's cathedral from the compound and just down the block there is John Fallon's pub for a pint of Guinness Extra Stout. The bedroom is quite small, but perfect for us to crash at the end of a long day. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend the place to any friend."
10380625,2017-05-08,290,17584346,Antoine,"Aoife is a really nice host, she was really convenient to help us to feel great in Dublin. Her place is quiete, really clean and 15 min walk from the city center. It was perfect for a short stay in Dublin."

She gave very detailed explanation how to find her place and made our task easy. The place is located in a little street with its own character, and the flat is very cosy and quiet. It is conveniently close to the city centre and to the main tourist attraction, and the walk to the centre is along nice streets. We definitely recommend Aoife's place. "

Aoife was really nice and took time to give us recommandations for places to shop, eat etc... She was also accommodating for our luggage on the last day, as we had a late flight."
44072174,2020-07-31,308,52925736,Noel John,The location of the house is excellent - very close to Westport town and all its amenties.  The scenery is breathtaking - at the front you are looking at The Reek and the back the Atlantic in all its splendour.  Its equally beautiful on a sunny day as a typical grey west of Ireland day!  We asked for an early check-in and the owner Eric was more than happy to accommodate us which was fantastic. The grass was cut to perfection also. The house itself is huge - and has a fine back garden again with fabulous views of Clew Bay. WiFi as you would expect is unreliable but that’s ok as this is a place to truly disconnect and relax. I asked about a TV in advance of booking as we have small kids plus we also like to unwind at night with a movie - in fairness the owner kindly sourced a small TV but it was located in the kitchen so wasn’t used much. I think the place would benefit from a TV in the lounge area especially for Winter breaks! Would I recommend Sea Symphony to friends and family - absolutely.  It’s huge by the way so is ideal for a large family gathering or a reunion with friends etc. I would 100% recommend the location too - it’s a great place to unwind and recharge.

44072174,2020-08-21,312,353563119,Laura,"The house was absolutely amazing, with magnificent views out every window of Croagh Patrick and the fabulous Irish Sea! Particularly spectacular when the sun sets in the evening time. Booked the house for 7 nights. Great value for money, in an excellent location less than 15 minutes from the beautiful town of Westport (which has lots of lovely restaurants and shops), and walking distance to a pub (The Tavern), Croagh Patrick Mountain and the sea. There are also a variety of lovely beaches to discover in the area, whether you are interested in swimming, surfing or just want to go for a stroll on one of them. The house was a lot bigger than expected, with lots of room for our large group. En-suite's in all six bedrooms was a bonus. It had everything that was needed for a comfortable, enjoyable and relaxing stay, including a large back garden and laundry room. The host, Eric, was very welcoming, and check-in was hassle free. Would definitely recommend anyone to stay in this house particularly a large group or family, and would love to return to it again myself."
44072174,2020-08-26,313,123917039,Jamie,Eric was a great host. Its in a great location next to the water. Near westport and next to Croagh Patrick.Penty of space and an ensuite in every room.

44161415,2020-07-23,315,356167256,Niamh,"Fantastic property in the Wexford countryside. Perfect for kids to wander freely. Our kids loved the freedom and we loved the peace and quiet! The apartment is extremely clean and tidy and has everything you need for your stay. The hosts make this place even more special. Maeve, Owen and the 3 kids are all soo friendly, warm and welcoming, our kids did not want to leave. This was the most relaxed and easy going holiday we have had and we cannot recommend this property enough. We will definitely be back!"
10380625,2017-09-04,316,140332314,Sam,"Great location! Nice, clean, quiet apartment. Aoife was away for the weekend but made sure to give us some recommendations before she left."
10380625,2017-09-18,317,62000453,Sean,Aoife's recomendations were spot-on and the apartment was in a great area  for a relaxed Dublin experience as well as access to the very popular Tepmle Bar district. The apartment itself was great and cozy.
10380625,2017-09-22,318,2372505,Jim,"Aoife was easy to get a hold of during the check in process and was timely in meeting you which was kind and great. Aoife offers you good recommendations but leaves you alone pretty much. I hardly saw or spoke with her as she was out and about as was I which was fine.The room is as described though best for a single traveler since small which suited me just well. The bed was comfortable though squeaks a little bit. The apartment was clean as was the bathroom and there was plenty of hot water despite what a previous poster had mentioned. My biggest concern was she brought home a late night guest which woke me up and despite her efforts to maintain quiet, I could hear them making conversation and other noises which still ended up not only being considerate as a host but also a security issue. I never had the opportunity to see her in person to have a conversation about it.The location is close to plenty of buses and really the whole city is fairly walkable if you have healthy legs. The neighborhood is nice and there are a couple excellent cafes nearby. Her apartment is well secure set away from the streets."
10380625,2017-09-25,319,105663761,Jack,The host was very easy to communicate with and was very helpful with suggestions. A nice place just what we needed and we enjoyed our stay in Dublin thanks to aoife.

10380625,2017-10-02,321,128370628,Jana,She's been so helpful with everything we needed. Her appartment is super clean and have felt like home for 3 days!!

10380625,2017-11-03,325,153964831,Yannick,"Je vous recommande vivement l'appartement de Aoife, tout d'abord parce que Aoife est super sympa et vraiment gentille. Et aussi parce que l'appartement est adorable et parfaitement propre. Je vous conseille plutôt de visiter Dublin entre potes (vu la quantité de pubs et de bars + ville étudiante) soit comme point de départ pour visiter l'Irlande. Car en fin de compte, la ville de Dublin n'est pas la plus jolie ville que j'ai visité avec ma compagne. Je vous rassure il y a quand même des choses sympas à aller voir, comme le Trinity College et sa bibliothèque, ou la Guiness Storehouse. Pour ce dernier, je vous encourage vivement à prendre vos billets sur le site internet, parce que sinon c'est un peu cher.Bonne visite"
10380625,2017-11-27,326,150292589,Alen,"Il soggiorno presso l'abitazione di Aoife è stato molto piacevole e confortevole.

43973708,2020-09-21,336,167424576,Geri,"Simply a lovely home. My son and I stayed here for three weeks while dropping him off at university in Dublin and we could not have been happier. It's a perfect space with plenty of room to spread out and even a little patio garden for getting outside (I already miss the roses and the bleeding heart blooming out there). The location really can't be better -- you're in Dublin, but on a quiet road that feels very private. If you get the chance to stay here, take it.

It's also within walking distance of all of the main attractions in Dublin. The apartment had everything you could possibly need and Aoife was a great host. She was also very accommodating and let me leave my bags at the apartment for a few hours after checking out. I honestly couldn't say anything bad about my stay and I would definitely book Aoife's place again in the future.
10380625,2018-04-17,339,183104364,Audrey,Aoife était une super hôte ! La chambre était très belle et  propre.

It was very cute and just like the pictures and was a perfect location for being close to a short walk away from the city center, but not too much in the heart of it that it got too overwhelming or noisy. She left us a tray of tea and coffee was a nice touch as well! The room is more perfect for couples, one person, or two people that don't mind being in such close quarters, but if you don't mind that this is a great place to stay for Dublin!"
10380625,2018-07-02,350,66117224,Danielle,"Aoife was really a wonderful host. She was very considerate and helped to arrange alternative check in procedures when our flight was delayed.

10380625,2018-09-27,366,144410212,Irene,"We immediately noticed Aoife’s a super host: she welcomed us recommending a place where to eat  before going to her house and then, once getting into it, she showed us some brochures about the things to do in the city and outside. She left us room and she was very kind to us. The position of the house is perfect, close to the main touristic points in Dublin. Our experience is absolutely positive. Thank you Aoife!"

10380625,2019-02-16,375,145881520,Katie,"I stayed at Aoife’s Place on my first solo trip. The check in process was very thoughtful and she provided me with maps and locations of some of the local spots to eat/shop. You get your own key to the apartment to come and go as you please which I loved because I had coach tours that started as early as 630am. The room is cozy and has all the amenities you need, like a electric kettle and multi plug charging bar. There was also a heat register so you could control if you wanted the room warmer. Her apartment was very conveniently located and was serviced by a bus stop that would take you to most areas of Dublin in a short 15 min ride. It does have 2 flights of stairs to walk up to reach the actual apartment (if you have any challenges with this - I did not) Overall, my stay was fantastic and I was able to see/do what I wanted in Dublin comfortably from Aoife’s Place. Thanks again!!"

10380625,2019-03-10,380,233634370,Jill,"Een erg schone kamer en badkamer en van alle gemakken voorzien. We mochten ook gebruikmaken van de koelkast. De locatie is prima, 10 minuten lopen vanaf het centrum met een supermarkt om de hoek.Het bed is echter wel wat aan de kleine kant.Wij hebben ons welkom gevoeld :)"

I'd absolutely stay with her again next time I'm in Dublin!"
10380625,2019-05-27,384,37241486,Cadene,"Perfect location! Super convenient. You can walk to Temple Bar in moments,  walk to a grocery and more coffee shops and restaurants than anyone could visit in a lifetime. Aoife could not have been more helpful. Definately a tight room for 2 with our big vacation baggage but the rest of the place is spacious."
10380625,2019-06-12,385,92834083,Franziska,"Aoife is a really great host. She gave us a lot of tips where to eat and where to go. The room was comfy and the flat cozy. The flat is situated in a quiet area, but still really central. We had a lovely time in Dublin and at Aoifes place."

10380625,2019-07-05,391,1262960,Rubin,"Aoife è davvero super. La stanza pur ridotta soddisfa ampiamente il soggiorno nella bellissima Dublino. Vantaggi dell'appartamento sono il parcheggio privato, la posizione centralissima, la quiete del giardino interno.... Non c'è niente di più da desiderare. Ahhh dimenticavo la piccola cagnolina, silenziosa ma sempre, se stuzzicata, a concedere tante coccole. Grazie Aoife"
10380625,2019-07-21,392,28910584,Nadine,"Ich hatte eine gute Zeit bei Aiofe. Das Zimmer sieht aus, wie auf den Bildern. Es ist zwar klein, aber gemütlich und ausreichend für eine Person. Obwohl Aiofe die ersten Tage nicht da war, hat der Check-in reibungslos funktioniert. Aiofe selbst ist wirklich unkompliziert und eine tolle Gastgeberin. Auch die Lage war Top. Alles ist fußläufig zu erreichen. Ich kann die Unterkunft sehr empfehlen!"

41501818,2020-02-21,398,330224249,Zuza,"Dave is a great guy. We were welcomed with a lil surprise but I won't give you a spoiler! Let's say it was Irish style. Communication with him is great, as he responds very quickly and leaves funny notes - once we got delicious cookies with one. Importantly, Dave respects privacy and we highly appreciated that."
10380625,2019-08-22,399,75480040,Michelle,"Perfect location, newly remodeled bathroom, nice touches like tea in our room. Great place. Aoife assisted us with ordering a cab, references to great pubs, and made us feel comfortable during our stay. We did have trouble getting in the room to get the keys on day 1. It is a gated apartment complex. You must ring the room to let someone know you are there."
10380625,2019-08-30,400,266799221,Bjarne,Very nice apartment and a very nice area.I can recomment Aoife and this apartment to all.If the apartment is free next time im in Dublin i will stay there for sure Kind regards Bjarne

10380625,2019-10-04,405,70081759,Mark,"Aoife is friendly and helpful and her place is convenient to most everything — especially St. Patrick's, which is just around the corner. Easy, but stimulating walks to Temple Bar, Grafton Street and to the north of the river. Great breakfast just up the street at The Fumbally, a recommendation of Aoife's; ate breakfast there twice and stopped in for coffee and cake one other time. Just a couple of blocks in the other direction from Aoife's is Spitalfield's, a fairly new place managed by a great guy (Declan) and with a great upscale menu, a fine selection of Irish whiskeys and friendly, knowledgeable bartenders. Aoife's is perfect for a solo traveler, plus there's Pumba the pug. Wonderful host, wonderful location, wonderful time."
10380625,2019-10-06,406,145672401,Jacob,Aoife's place is in an ideal location. 15min walk to literally anything you want to do or see in Dublin.

10380625,2019-10-12,408,89569945,Noelle,"This is The place to stay while in Dublin! Exactly as described, a cozy room with a double bed. The place itself is stylish, neat, clean, and literally close to the places we wanted to go! We walked all over Dublin and this was the perfect place to relax at the end of the day. My husband and I spent two nights here at the beginning of our trip to Ireland and Aoife was very helpful and kind. She responded quickly to messages too. When we arrived we thought that her place was a blue door with a #20 on it, down the road a bit. There is a gate to enter the apartment complex where there is parking (free) there. Overall we will definitely look for Aoife's place on airbnb if we stay in Dublin again!"
10380625,2019-10-20,409,268529254,Emma,Aoife were really helpful and everything went very smooth. The place is super nice and clean and I experienced no problems what so ever. Great location. And the dog is super cute and friendly.

The apartment is walking distance to everything and close to cute restaurants and shops. The apartment is clean and cozy, and playing with Pumbaa is a great way to spend time between adventures. Aoife is probably the best AirBnB host I have ever had, she was quick to respond to all messages, came and let me in early, had lots of great tips and hints for enjoying my four days in Dublin and was interesting to chat with. I would stay here again in a heart beat."
10380625,2019-12-01,413,39766024,Sophie,Aoife's flat is gorgeous and spotless.  It is in an amazing location with great local spots around. Would highly recommend a stay here!

9912531,2016-02-14,424,12763146,Vito,"Angelique was extremely friendly. Her place felt like a home away from home, it's quite spacious and well furnished (and on her sofa you will find the softest blanker ever! :D). It's very easy to walk to the city centre (15 mins or so) or get to/from the airport from there.I'd recommend it!"
9912531,2016-02-17,425,15706107,Helen,The host canceled this reservation 31 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
9912531,2016-03-19,426,31002625,Chris,"I had the chance to stay at Angel and Sebastien’s Airbnb for a few nights. They were extremely helpful on check-in and tips, they even provided their portable speak, coffee, and tea for us. It was very easy to communicate and reach them when I had questions. The location of the Airbnb is a very short walk from the centre of the city with a groceries store right outside. My trip in Dublin was one to remember and this would not have been the case if I did not stay here. I would recommend this place to others."
9912531,2016-03-29,427,16715333,Anna,"Sweet Place in Dublin was indeed sweet - the apartment is very cozy and comfy, and well located within walking distance of most landmarks.

Kudos and recommended!"
9912531,2016-05-08,428,63769187,Julianne,"We had a very pleasant experience staying at this apartment. The address listed was not accurate if you put it into (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps, but Angelique was in contact and we were able to meet up with little difficulty. The apartment was clean and very comfortable. She showed us how to use the keys properly, as well as the shower and facilities in the apartment. She helped us hook up to the WiFi and gave us maps and pamphlets to look at for things to do while in Dublin. Angelique remained in contact with us throughout the trip to make sure we were okay in the apartment. Leaving the keys were no problem, and we would love to stay here again."
9912531,2016-06-05,429,12093407,Christine,"Sebastien greeted us and made sure we had everything we needed - very sweet and welcoming. The place was a little further away from the city center but was a great little place to spend our final nights in Dublin. Apartment was a nice size and was clean. Door can be a little tricky to figure out - make sure one of the hosts show you. Otherwise, no complaints!"
38833329,2019-10-10,430,165674109,Diane,"Amalia's place was terrific. 15-20 minute walk into center of city.  Comfy bed and great water pressure. Amalia was friendly, helpful and understanding when my flight was late. I would stay again and recommend to others."
38833329,2019-10-13,431,100622595,Rick,"Location perfect for city traveller, the host is amazingly responsive.Would stay again without a doubt."

45429319,2020-10-11,434,2132101,Wynand,Super clean. Quiet neighbourhood. Super host. I will rate this stay as absolutely great.
37810719,2019-09-30,435,6734369,Megan,"Ieva’s apartment is perfectly located in Dublin. It was easy to walk everywhere - to all the big landmarks - in under 15 minutes. It was cozy, super clean and came with the cutest and friendliest cat. I highly recommend her apartment to anyone who wants easy access to great live music, food and cafes. Ieva was stellar with communication - quick to answer messages prior to and during our stay."
37074833,2019-07-29,436,84668755,Alan,"We enjoyed everything about staying with Karen, and are honored to be her first guests.  She's thoughtful, considerate, and has everything a guest could need.  Her country farmhouse is wonderful, with friendly dogs, cats, and 4 chickens.  And we really enjoyed watching the sunset outside with a nice fire in the firepit.  It's one of our favorite Airbnb's ever!"
7954546,2015-08-26,437,9770575,Óscar,"El anfitrión Paul es increíblemente atento y simpático.Fue una experiencia muy agradable. El apartamento esta creo en el mejor sitio. Con vistas al río, camas cómodas, todo nuevo, volveré.Esta ubicado en el centro pero sin ruidos, todo muy cerca, y muy seguro. En frente de Temple Bar, pero sin estar encima. Cruzando el puente."
7954546,2015-09-03,438,28328181,Chris,"Paul was an amazing host. He was very prompt with all communication, and catered to all our needs. He was very friendly and happily offered up his experience on the best places to eat and drink in Dublin. The place was clean, spacious, well-stocked and exactly as described. The apartment was in an excellent location too. There were some very cool places to eat nearby (I highly recommend brother hubbard, the food and coffee is fantastic) and everything in Dublin we wanted to see was minutes away by foot. The view from all rooms over the river Liffey is excellent and Temple Bar is just across the bridge for those so inclined.Overall a really great stay, and I’d happily choose this place again when I return to Dublin."
7954546,2015-09-07,439,41643931,Kirstin,"Had a great first experience of Airbnb with Paul as our host. All communication was very efficient, Paul met  us on arrival and emailed with further information on Dublin during our stay. The apartment is immaculate and in a fabulous spot from where you can walk in minutes to the centre of town across the River Liffey -it was also very secure which was important for ladies travelling alone. We were left cereals, fruit, milk, bread, coffee etc which was very welcome. If coming back to Dublin would definitely make Paul's apartment the first choice. There are great cafes right next door to the apartment. "
7954546,2015-09-11,440,42503163,Giulia,"Best location and one of the most lovelly apartment I've ever been to. Paul is a very nice host, he made sure that everything was perfect for us.  Highly recommend his apartment."
7954546,2015-09-14,441,11367884,Thomas,Our trip and Paul´s appartment were a great experience. Everything is as described and we felt like at home. Paul is a quick and helpful communicator who was really interested in supporting us to have a pleasant stay. The unique location of the appartment close to river and tempelbar was ideal for us. We strongly recommend.
7954546,2015-09-17,442,42950644,George,"Paul and Nico were great. Very friendly, helpful, communicative. Apartment is very clean and nice, even better than described. Highly recommended."
7954546,2015-09-21,443,33763027,Ed,"The flat is just what we wanted, very conveniently located, clean and comfortable, and at a very reasonable price. Paul was a great host going above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. I would definitely recommend."
7954546,2015-09-23,444,23597969,Miriam,"The listing was accurate and the neighborhood is great - right in the heart of dublin next to the bridge and temple bar area so it was great to walk around. The issue was that the hot water and shower head were not working. The apartment fits 4 and my group was a total of 4. One of us started showering first with very low pressure and then when the 2nd started to shower, the head of the shower didn't work at all. She just showered with the bath faucet and a couple minutes later, it was just cold water. We didn't get hot water until Paul came in to check it out. Afterwards, another one used the shower once and then when the last girl went into shower, there wasn't any hot water again, even when we turned on the boost, and then the water pressure was very very weak. Everything else was fine but not being able to get a nice hot shower while traveling in colder weather was a damper to the drip. "
7954546,2015-09-25,445,42182353,Mick,"This was the first time I've used Airbnb and it was great, I'll definitely use it again. Right from the start, before I even made the booking, Paul was very helpful. I communicated via email and he always responded quickly. After the booking was confirmed Paul continued the good communications and helpful advice. We had a problem with our flights but managed to let Paul know.  Paul and Nico were very helpful guiding us to the apartment door by phone and letting us check in later than agreed.  We also had to do the checkin very quickly (two minutes!) as we had to drop our bags and run to get to the theatre on time for the show we'd booked. The apartment was very clean with good facilities, very secure and perfect for our needs. My mother has difficulty with stairs but there are lifts so being on the third floor was no problem. The location was perfect, right in the centre of the city. Fantastic views over the river to the Temple Bar area. Three of us in my party had no problem sleeping but my wife is a very light sleeper and couldn't sleep because of the noise from the street and from Temple Bar. If you're a light sleeper take ear plugs!  We only ate breakfast in the apartment for which there was plenty of choice of cereals, bread, eggs, tea, coffee, etc. The kitchen was well equipped if you wanted to do more than just breakfast. Some people have mentioned difficulty with the shower and there is undoubtedly a knack to it. I found that lying the shower head in the bath then turning the water on and waiting for it to flow from the shower before turning the pump on worked fine. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend Airbnb and Paul’s apartment in Dublin.  Thank you very much Paul and Nico."
7954546,2015-09-26,446,41509841,Tamika,Excellent apartment. The location was perfect and Paul was a great host. We would definitely recommend!
7954546,2015-09-27,447,10528062,Andrew,"Paul was a very welcoming host, who graciously met us at the apartment upon our arrival, despite fairly last minute changes to our plans. We arrived earlier than scheduled and the apartment wasn't quite ready yet, but he was still able to accommodate us and let us in to drop off our stuff and collect the keys. The apartment is perfectly situated, within close walking distance to anything and everything! Very spacious and well maintained - Paul was also kind enough to buy some breakfast food for us. Overall, great apartment, great host, and would definitely recommend!"
7954546,2015-09-28,448,7757298,Mary,"We had such a great time at Paul's place in Dublin. Everything was perfect from the location, to the fresh flowers and fresh fruits, to the comfortable and quiet rooms. Would stay again in heartbeat. Thanks. "
7954546,2015-09-29,449,8899335,Matt,"Paul was a great host, very friendly and helpful.  The apartment is very clean, perfectly located and very tastefully decorated.  Paul goes above and beyond.  I highly recommend this place."
7954546,2015-10-02,450,29172191,Shanee,"Wonderful stay at a really lovely apartment. Paul was extremely nice and accomodating and always available, the apartment is really lovely and comfortable as well as exceptionally clean and above all is in the perfect location.The water pressure in the shower isn't good if that bothers you, but other than that, everything was great!"
7954546,2015-10-04,451,22422023,Ronald,"Paul was flexible and accommodating.  Provided us with great instructions and also a couple extra perks (which were greatly appreciated).  The unit is in a great location (FYI, to avoid confusion the address is Ha"" Penny Bridge House, unit 40 and not 40 Ha' Penny Bridge).  Cafes right downstairs, great restaurants in walking distance, nightlife right across the bridge, and close proximity to sites.  We were happy with our stay.Note: This is an older unit but very clean and spacious.  The shower is hot but water pressure is definitely lower.  "
7954546,2015-10-06,452,41934781,Jo,Really great location in amongst everything and friendly host. Paul allowed us early access just to drop the bags off which was really useful. The apartment is a little spartan but has most things. There's no TV which isn't a massive issue but would have been nice to have. Road can be noisy but that was expected. All in all a nice comfy and convenient base for our short stay.
7954546,2015-10-09,453,16490275,Mario,"Paul was a great host. He was always kind and helpful and solved every issue with elegance.The apartment is fantastic (clean and well furnished) and the position is ...like 30sec from everything. In the mornings there are beautiful places nearby to have breakfast (as Italian I advise to go to the ""Il Fornaio"" for a great cappuccino). Temple Bar is just a hip away...I hardly believe there is a better way to visit Dublin (and surroundings) then Pauls apartment."
7954546,2015-10-11,454,42730151,Trisha,"We just wrapped up our stay in Dublin and I have to say Paul's place was perfect for us! Centrally located, very well kept and warm blankets on the bed. Paul was very responsive to my communications and was a very gracious host. We even had fruit, eggs, milk and bread to get us started. Fresh flowers in the house was a nice touch. If I find myself in Dublin, Paul's place is top of my list. Thank you for making our introduction to Ireland a splendid one. "
7954546,2015-10-15,455,41127358,George,"Lovely place in the perfect location. Close to the sight seeing bus stops, restaurants and the Temple Bar pub area. Paul was a great host. "
7954546,2015-10-16,456,44382787,Jeani,There was a small hiccup as our flight was delayed. With the help of some very kind neighbors we were sorted in no time. Paul has a beautiful space in a great location. It was very clean and had everything you would need available. He also offered some advice on places to see and where to eat. We had a great stay.
7954546,2015-10-20,457,30070525,Shell,"Apartment was lovely in a great location as described, everything we needed for our brief visit. Thanks paul for leaving us bread, coffee, milk etc .Paul met us on arrival and provided us with all we needed to know as well as local recommendations."
7954546,2015-10-22,458,33043399,Christopher,Super nice and very helpful. The apartment was clean and right smack in the middle of everything. Only flaw was low water pressure in bathroom. Would stay there again in a heartbeat 
7954546,2015-10-24,459,1321640,Allison,"Paul was so welcoming, with a great smile, very responsive, and even goodies like bread and fruit in the apartment.  He let me check in early because I was dead from the flight, and even carried my bag upstairs for me!  The apartment is exactly as described with that terrific location.  It is a pretty basic rental property.  Beds are comfy and lounge is a good hang out spot.  Wifi is good.  Water pressure is abominable but Paul warned me about that. The first night something with club music went on until 3:30am but the second night all was quiet early.  "
7954546,2015-10-27,460,42472963,Sarah,"Fantastic weekend away in Dublin. Perfect location across the road from Temple Bar. Paul was a wonderful host, meeting us after our late flight to show us the accommodation, complimentary breakfast food which was a lovely touch. When we are in Dublin again we would definitely stay here. "
7954546,2015-10-28,461,46885198,笑,The room is clean and big. Paul prepared everything you need. Nice house!
7954546,2015-10-30,462,2925882,Natasha,"GREAT location and lovely apartment.  It couldn't be closer to everything.  The space was clean and well-maintained.  Nice touches of having breakfast provided!  We had some plumbing problems that Paul took care of right away.  Make sure you know how to work the heater system - we got that wrong and didn't have hot water one morning, but once we were shown it was fine!  Highly recommend for a great area to stay in Dublin!"
7954546,2015-11-02,463,2567676,Jill,"Paul gives an accurate description of his place.  It is so central to everything that we didn't use public transport at all.  Being central meant that our sleep,was disturbed by late night revellers -but it was Halloween, a big event in Ireland. The apartment is very comfortable.  The only improvement could be better water pressure in the shower but this seems to be common everywhere in Ireland!Paul made us feel very comfortable, greeting us when we arrived (early) and kindly allowed us to leave our luggage after the check out time as we had a late flight. The place was spotlessly clean and suited us four adults. Would certainly stay here again."
7954546,2015-11-08,464,42700936,Zerena,"Paul made us feel very welcome, leaving breakfast and tea and coffee etc and he was very accommodating allowing us to leave our luggage in the apartment after the checkout time.  The location of the apartment is perfect and you can explore all of the main sites by foot. There are also lots of amenities close by with shopping centres, supermarkets and restaurants all a stones throw away. The apartment also has really good security which was very reassuring for us staying with 2 children"
7954546,2015-11-09,465,16322158,Severine,"Lovely, warm flat, very well located in the city center of Dublin! "

The trip was a pleasure."

7954546,2015-11-23,468,24978122,Emma,"WOW! What a location, everything that you could possibly need for a weekend away just a few minutes walk from the apartment and if you enjoy people watching you could spend hours watching the comings and goings over the Millennium Bridge.The kitchen basics provided were appreciated, and it meant that we were able to have breakfast and get going each morning.Free Internet access enabled us to research our next step.Excellent communication from Paul from the moment of booking and I really felt that I could contact him at any point should we have any questions. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again if I found myself in Dublin. "
7954546,2015-11-27,469,41098936,Kati,"The apartment is in an ideal location. Dublin is right outside your front door.  There are several eateries within steps, and Temple Bar area is right over the bridge.  We walked everywhere we needed to go, even to train station for some trips outside of the city. We found everything to be exactly as pictured and very clean and comfortable.  Paul was easily accessible and responsive via e-mail."
7954546,2015-12-01,470,7193144,Amélie,"The appartment was really nice, very clean and big enough to host all 4 of us. It was right accross Temple Bar, a couple feet away accross the bridge. Paul was really nice, very welcoming and looking after our comfort. He offered breakfast, fruits, games, readings and maps, all you nees for a perfecg stay in Dublin! We highly recommand his appartment :)"

7954546,2015-12-18,476,4832060,Lainey,"Good apartment for a holiday in Dublin. The location is great for getting to many places to go, including the hop on hop off bus, Temple Bar, Christ Church, Dublinia, etc. I stayed there with my children and mother. My only little warning is that being in a great location means quite a bit of traffic noise at night. I live in the country so perhaps I'm more sensitive than others as I haven't noted it in other reviews.Paul was very responsive via email."

7954546,2015-12-31,480,17649576,Megan,"What a lovely apartment overlooking the river Liffey. Great location and quite a lot of space for 3 people. I love the view over the millennium bridge; getting to eat breakfast while watching the Dubliners go about their day in the morning was a wonderful way to start the day.    We didn't get to meet Paul but  he generously made arrangements to accommodate our very late arrival time. We were very appreciative of the amenities and light breakfast foods he left for us due to this late arrival. The only issue we had was with the shower  pressure as other commentators have mentioned. Overall great place, and would certainly recommend to anyone coming to Dublin."
7954546,2016-01-05,481,17606541,Justine,Good locationWe had a great time
7954546,2016-01-10,482,30659820,Sara,"I picked the Pauls place based on location and aesthetics. His place has an amazing view of the River and it was in a great location.The rooms, main living room, and kitchen area were all nice. We were only here for 2 nights but enjoyed our stay. Everything was in a reasonable walking distance (Guinness, Jameson, Trinity College etc). It was fun. "
7954546,2016-01-12,483,12899306,Daisy,"The flat is perfectly located in the centre of the city with all the majority of sites in easy walking distance, particularly Temple Bar which is just over the bridge. The property itself was clean and well equipped, with breakfast materials left for us. Paul was also very flexible about check in and check out times which proved very handy based on the time of our flight home."
7954546,2016-01-18,484,11101802,Morten Johan,Communication with Paul was fine. Paul let us use the appartement an hour before check in time since there hadn't been any guests prior to us.
7954546,2016-01-20,485,43114938,Katherine,"Paul was a great host, very understanding when our arrival was delayed a few hours, and he promptly responds to messages.  His apartment is spacious with really great views over the bridge, and stellar location--right in the middle of the city.  We were able to walk everywhere and not take a single taxi while staying in Dublin.  One star deduction because the bathroom light burned out when we were there, and the water pressure situation was a little difficult to figure out, even with his initial instructions.  Still, I am sure he's fixed them by now, and would recommend this flat to everyone."
7954546,2016-01-22,486,46433152,Eddie,"Paul is alot taller than I thought :)  he gave us a very warm welcome, quick tour on the house.  Great location for dinning and shopping.

It was very clean and Paul was an excellent host, greeting us and providing us with milk, bread and eggs. The best thing of all was the location, literally a 30 second walk to the heart of temple bar. Would definitely stay again."
7954546,2016-03-22,504,38739662,Pascal G.,"Das Apartment war exakt wie beschrieben, einfach zu finden und auch die Schlüsselübergabe mit Pauls Freundin war herrlich unkompliziert. Auch wenn ich Paul selbst nicht kennen gelernt habe, war er sehr zuvorkommend, antwortete schnell, hatte viele Empfehlungen für uns und stellte uns am ersten Morgen sogar ein kleines Frühstück zusammen. Die Wohnung selbst liegt tatsächlich MITTEN in der Stadt, wir sind zu keiner Sehenswürdigkeit länger als 10 Minuten gelaufen und besonders am St. Patrick's Day war es angenehm, dem Trubel mal für ein paar Stunden im eigenen City Apartment zu entfliehen. Wer natürlich eine Wohnung mitten in der Stadt und somit auch an einer stark befahrenen Hauptstraße bucht, muss mit der entsprechenden Lautstärke Nachts rechnen. Ohrstöpsel verschaffen hier aber Abhilfe. Alles in allem war es ein gelungener Aufenthalt. Danke. "
7954546,2016-03-22,505,26707335,John,"Paul and his wife met us at the apartment at a time that was convenient for us. They were VERY nice and gave us some info about local places to eat, which we really appreciated. The apartment was in a great location and was exactly like the pictures. It had two large bedrooms and a nice living room and sitting area. They even left eggs and cereal for us. A very nice touch! The apartment was very clean. I wish we could have stayed there another night as the apartment was right in the middle of everything!!! I would definitely rent from them again. Thanks, Paul!!!"

7954546,2016-03-26,507,5490599,Megan,"Everything was exactly as listed and we (4 people) had a great stay. The location was excellent, and everything we wanted to see and do - on both sides of the river - was a manageable walk away.The only thing to be aware of is that the very central location means that some traffic noise in inevitable, so it might be wise to bring earplugs if you are not used to urban living.Overall, the apartment was everything that we needed, in a perfect city centre location."
7954546,2016-03-31,508,42707986,Helena,"Location location location and this property was perfect for staying in the heart of Dublin. There was also coffee, tea, fruit, cereals etc provided which was really appreciated. We were a family of 4 and we really enjoyed our stay."
7954546,2016-04-02,509,10935696,Stephanie,"Great location in Dublin Center. Perfect for our family's one night stay or longer if our time permitted. Very clean and super nice touch with the milk, cereal, oranges and tea for breakfast. Definitely we recommend to others and stay there again during future visits. "
7954546,2016-04-04,510,51765123,Karen,"The apartment was clean and comfortable and the location was perfect. Paul was extremely helpful prior to our visit and quick to respond to any queries. The apartment was a stone's throw away from the city centre and Temple Bar. We would recommend a trip to the Guinness Storehouse and to prebook tickets to Kilmainham Gaol to avoid disappointment. We loved Dublin, and will definately be back!KarenApril 2016"

37074833,2019-08-13,512,39639572,Marion,Karen welcomed us in warmly and made us feel at home. The location is beautiful and the bed was very soft and cozy. Great stay in the beautiful country side of Cork.
37074833,2019-08-19,513,86384946,Althéa,"Karen est très gentille et accueillante. Sa maison est grande et vous permet une certaine indépendance. Néanmoins, la maison est très excentrée de la ville et il faut prévoir de bien se couvrir car la maison n’est pas très bien chauffée."
36911477,2019-07-28,514,278632849,Liz,"Sian went above and beyond to ensure I had a perfect stay at her lovely spacious and sparkling clean apartment. Little notes of instruction were great. I was in need of nothing. She was also always contactable on the phone in case I had any issue at all, no matter now small. I wish all Airbnb hosts were as great as Sian. The apartment is also in a great location in Limerick city close to everything you need. Would definitely recommend a stay at her apartment."
7954546,2016-04-06,515,61204617,John,"Paul was fantastic, made sure everything ran smoothly and made the entire experience very enjoyable"
7954546,2016-04-08,516,39652026,Sarina,"If you want to be minutes from all the hustle and bustle of Dublin, this is the perfect apartment. The location is fantastic because you're literally across from the beautiful Ha'penny Bridge and minutes from enjoying the Temple Bar area and beyond. We did have a little bit of trouble with the shower because it was a bit finnicky, but if you're just looking for a place to drop all your stuff as you explore the city during the day/night, this is it. I cannot think of a more central location for our Dublin trip and the value is pretty good considering the location. Paul was also very accommodating and allowed us to check in later in the night because we were traveling from Galway. The check-out process was also very easy which is great because when you're in a hurry to get to the airport, the last thing you want to worry about is whether or not you completed all the check out steps. All in all, I cannot emphasize enough how great the location of this apartment is--and how great a view you get from the windows! "
7954546,2016-04-11,517,36192716,Victor & Elisabete,"Obrigado pela excelente localização.É uma casa no centro e por isso algum barulho, estive na casa com mais 1 casal e um miúdo de 9 meses e foi tudo perfeito para descobrir Dublin.Recomendo!"

7954546,2016-04-15,519,8757342,Dominik,Paul was very kind to us and welcomed us very friendly. He alway's answered our questions as fast as possible. The appartment is exactly like the discription on Airbnb. What you see is what you get. The location is perfect! You leave the house and you are in the centre. Just perfect for our visit's to the pub's :)So for our next visit I would come here again.1 small disadvantage was the matras. 
7954546,2016-04-21,520,63129912,Patrick,The location of this flat is perfect!  So easy to get all around Dublin!
7954546,2016-04-24,521,22393308,Paul,Perfect location right on the River Liffy next to the Millenium Bridge and close to sights and the Temple Bar district. The apartment was just what we needed. Thanks To Paul for being the perfect host!
7954546,2016-04-27,522,54217201,Anna,"It was a wonderful 2 days spent in Dublin. Perfect location to walk around the city. Paul was very quick to respond to my emails regarding directions and recommendations. The flat was perfectly located within the city, very comfortable to stay in. There was plenty of breakfast cereals and coffee/tea to start our morning. Only concern was the water pressure. Was slow to recover. Would love to come back again. "
7954546,2016-04-28,523,59844046,Libo,"Paul and his company were great and they managed to fit our schedule and gave us keys and instructions. The apartment was very clean and neat, has great location as one can expect. We had a great stay for 1 night."
7954546,2016-05-01,524,29760503,Judy,"Paul's apartment is in a great location in Dublin, easy walking distance to the Temple Bar district and Jameson.  The train and metro are just a few blocks away, making expanding your sightseeing a snap.  "

7954546,2016-05-08,527,9850093,Mie,We (=4) stayed for 4 nights at Paul's place. GREAT location just across the Temple Bar district. Upon arrival Paul wasn't there so had to call him a few times before he answered - 30 min later Loreen came down to let us in.The apartment suited our needs perfectly - the noise from the road is quite loud so remember to bring earplogs. We didn't take advantage of the included breakfast as this was solely cereal/milk but nice offer. I highly recommend staying at Paul's place if you prefer a central location for a few days visit.
7954546,2016-05-09,528,45780691,Jill Louise,Great location and security. Wifi was good. Thank you

7954546,2016-05-13,531,9602748,Ann,"Paul made sure that we had everything we needed including clear information about how to get into the apartment. There was lots of food for a cold breakfast including milk and fruit. The rooms were just as described; lots of storage and a nice bathroom. We knew the neighbourhood. It is fun with Temple Bar just across the Liffey, food shops nearby for eating in and even closer to The Winding Stair for great book shopping. Also quite close to the Jervis Centre and O'Connell Street for a variety of shops."
7954546,2016-05-16,532,9844606,Daniela,"Perfect, central location right in the city centre. Clean house and apartment with a well equipped kitchen.

7954546,2016-05-22,534,48701527,Michaele,"Die Wohnung war wie beschrieben und auf den Bildern zu sehen. Perfekt für 2 Paare. Die Lage  ist absolut top. Bei unserer Ankunft war jemand da zur Schlüsselübergabe. Alles sehr sauber, sogar Milch, Kaffee, Cornflakes und ein Obstkorb standen bereit. Da sie an einer stark befahrenen Straße liegt ist es entsprechend laut, aber dafür ist man halt auch mittendrin und vieles ist zu Fuß erreichbar. Ich würde die Wohnung weiterempfehlen und noch einmal dort buchen. Michaele, Thomas, Doris+Boris"
7954546,2016-05-24,535,15572073,Sahi,"Die Wohnung ist absolut zentral und perfekt für einen kurzen Aufenthalt in Dublin. Sie ist sauber und mit allem ausgestattet was man benötigt - plus Blumen!Paul hat sich vor der Ankunft mit uns ausgetauscht und alle Fragen beantwortet, so dass der Check-in perfekt geklappt hat.Wenn man zum Schlafen viel Ruhe benötigt, ist die Wohnung nicht das richtige, da sie an einer viel befahrenen Straße liegt und die Fenster sehr schlecht isoliert sind."
7954546,2016-05-28,536,55710974,Bryan,Excellent apartment in an excellent central location. Everything we needed and clear instructions.

7954546,2016-06-04,538,54225115,Paige,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Everything was clean and well kept. As 4 girls traveling from the states, the location was great and felt very safe and secure. Paul was also very accommodating with our early check-in. Overall definitely a great apartment and we would stay here again! "
7954546,2016-06-08,539,10662260,Rene,"An immaculately clean, airy and spacious apartment. We particularly enjoyed the white lilies and oranges on our arrival. We made the mistake of not letting Paul know the time of our arrival. This was surely an inconvenience for him and his staff. Please don't make the same mistake if you can help it.We had some trouble with flushing the toilet. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. I think we just didn't understand the mechanism since I encountered similar problems in the UK.The mattresses were problematic. I think they must be box springs since all sorts of metal wiring poked our ribs and backs. I'm sure Paul will check this out.You may have read that this is a noisy part of town. The 3rd floor has 3 windows and faces the river. Dublin's boozers were still howling at 5 a.m. on Saturday, well after sunrise. I don't think I would want to stay more than just a few days. Of course, if you plan on joining the party across the river, this will not be a problem.The neighborhood seems to be a ""little Italy"" with all sorts of Italian restaurants surrounding. We did not hear much English spoken here or along the river. If it were not for the noise, it would really be quite nice. Public transportation is abundant and all within easy walks. Large supermarkets are about 10 minutes to the back and many small & expensive convenience stores are scattered all about.We took the AirLink bus from the airport which only cost 10 euros, round trip. It can drop you off at the College Green stop across the river. This works well if you don't have much, or heavy, luggage. You will then want to cross the Millennium Bridge to get to the apartment. It was also easy to get back to the airport on the return trip.A note to US travelers: Dublin has US customs and immigration right there at the airport. This means that you will arrive back in the states at your domestic flights terminals and you can just pick up your bags and leave. However... it means you have to go through security twice in Dublin, and stand in lines to fill out forms and go through clearance. It can add 45 minutes to your wait time, so arrive earlier at the airport than you normally would. I'm not sure that I really liked this. It could be very awkward if you were making a connecting flight from somewhere else in Europe.Enjoy your pizza!"
7954546,2016-06-11,540,46266551,ScottandSiobhan,"This apartment is right in the city - just across the Liffey from the Temple Bar district. The noise is a bit much at times, however with such a central city location, it's to be expected. The apartment was clean and serviceable, the fruit on the table a nice touch. I didn't notice prior to arrival that the apartment doesn't have a tv! We tend to use the tv in the evening prior to dinner for the kids - and for our sanity, so that was missed. You have everything you could need within easy walking distance. A good couple of days chilling out in Dublin, Thanks Paul!"
7954546,2016-06-13,541,59790784,Paul D.,"Paul's apartment was exactly as described and shown in the pictures.  It is truly a ""stunning"" location!  Paul was very flexible with our arrival time as we tried to figure it out and changed it.  The only negative was the noise.  I had expected city noise but I hadn't realized that the music from across the river would be as loud as it was.  And it was too warm to close the windows.  That said, we think the good things about the apartment outweighed that inconvenience and would certainly recommend Paul's apartment."
7954546,2016-06-15,542,22172697,Bar,Paul was perfect! Great communication made getting settled easy. The view from the appartment over the river is wonderful. We spent hours just watching Dublin walk past. 
7954546,2016-06-20,543,5751586,Barry,"Paul was not able to meet us in person but his associate did and check in worked just fine.The space was just as described and was perfect for us.  The location in Dublin for this apartment simply can not be bested by other locations, directly across the Millennial bridge from Temple Bar which reduces the noise while being perfectly convenient.The space is perhaps rather small as a two bedroom -- but was fine for us as middle aged couple.Also, we did a day over next day back to Galway trip and again, the location of this apartment is perfect for using the express bus.When we return to Dublin, this place will be on the top of the list."
7954546,2016-06-22,544,57181148,Byron,"Wow. We all loved staying at Paul's apartment. The location is exceptional and in walking distance to almost everything we wanted to see in our short Dublin visit (i.e., Temple Bar, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Guinness Brewery, Jameson's Whiskey Distillery, Trinity College, etc.). We particularly loved all the pubs with live music just across the bridge .  Paul was a wonderful host and very helpful in maximizing our visit. The apartment was clean and in excellent condition. "
7954546,2016-06-24,545,15300050,Eve,"We had a great stay in Paul's apartment. Location was very convenient and the place was beautiful.There was a big football match on the night we stayed, so we expected some noise but had no issues. Even though Temple Bar is just across the river, it's far enough away to avoid the tourist area. Although I didn't get to meet Paul (his friend Titi greeted me and showed me around), he was a fantastic host, really easy to communicate with and so helpful.Would definitely stay here again."
7954546,2016-06-24,546,31306113,James,"Paul's place at Ha'Penny House was absolutely great. Awesome location on the river with in walking distance to restaurants, bars, shopping and historical attractions. Apartment itself was both clean and very comfortable. It also has a great view of the bridges spanning the River Liffey and the river itself. If we weren't out in the city so much it would have been perfect to relax in as well. Paul was very accomodating and gave us several great tips for where to go in the city. I would highly recommend both Paul and this location to others looking for a great time in Dublin. "
7954546,2016-06-25,547,51515093,Andrew,The flat was excellent- well appointed and just as described.  Would definitely recommend/stay there again.
7954546,2016-06-29,548,21329222,Parisa,"My sister and I stayed at Paul's place for 4 nights and we had some mixed feelings. Overall, we really enjoyed the area and location. The apartment building felt very safe and the views were great! The apartment was clean and very roomy, which was a plus. Paul also seemed very pleasant during our email exchanges, and even was nice enough to let us drop our bags off early. There were a few downsides though. The beds are quite uncomfortable, with springs poking up from underneath. Also, the street noise from below is audible all night through the bedroom windows. This could be a problem for some people, but luckily we were tired enough each night to sleep through it. Another issue was a lack of hot water from any of the taps in the apartment (plus no water pressure). The good thing is that you can get a hot water boost by pressing a button 30 minutes before you need it. This is good for showers, but bad for when you need hot water right away.  The hob didn't work while we were there, so we couldn't cook any eggs for breakfast. But the biggest disappointment of all for me was that the washing machine didn't work correctly and actually ruined some of my clothes. This frustrated me so much because I'd already been traveling for two weeks prior to my stay in Dublin and had been counting on being able to wash my clothes there. I ended up washing everything in the sink. Although there were some good points about this place, I think I'd look for a different place to stay in Dublin next time."

7954546,2016-07-03,550,952687,Chris,This was a great place to explore Dublin.  Right in the middle of everything in the city and easy access to the Luas.  The apartment was very comfortable and everyone in the building was very friendly.  Would recommend highly.
7954546,2016-07-09,551,28450909,John,"We arrived at Paul's apartment and was greeted by Tito. Tito was very nice and welcomed us in. The view of the river and the location was fantastic! Paul stopped by a bit later to introduce himself. He was very nice and had many suggestions of what we could do during our stay. Paul had also bought us some fruit and had maps provided for us at the apartment.We had four people in our group and ran out of hot water a couple of times. The building also had some water pressure issues due to how old it is.All in all, it's a fantastic location located right on River Liffey. It is very easy to walk anywhere within the city center. If you are coming from the Dublin Airport, it is only 4-5 blocks from AirLink bus stop."
7954546,2016-07-11,552,57503163,Georgina,"The apartment was in an amazing location as long as you don't mind the noise of Temple Bar area. We were a 10 minute walk to everywhere at most. The apartment was clean and we had tea, coffee and milk waiting for us. We were early and they tried their hardest to get us into the apartment as soon as they could. "
7954546,2016-07-14,553,27955703,Darlene,"My husband and I loved Paul's Ha'Penny Bridge apartment. We were greeted able to leave our luggage as we had arrived on an early flight and given keys to return a bit later. Everything was very smooth.The apartment is very clean and chic. Getting around Dublin was very easy on foot, so many sites to see and wonderful places to eat. Paul has alot of information in the apartment to read and also gave suggestions. Paul was very helpful if we had questions and got back to me quite quickly.I would recommend Paul's apartment it's the perfect location to explore Dublin!Thank you Paul for hosting us.Darlene & Richard"

7954546,2016-07-24,556,7328558,Gary,"From very first contact, Paul was very easy to contact and responded promptly - he couldn't do any more to support with trip planning and would provide recommendations for our visit. The location is simply perfect - lovely view of the river and a matter of minutes walk from the crazy hustle and bustle of Temple Bar. There is also a great café downstairs for breakfasts! Beds were comfortable and layout was as expected, we had no problems with the hot water/ shower (which some mention in their feedback) - Paul provides clear instructions on how to get best use of shower and hot water. The only thing we felt the apartment could do with is something to play music on (eg docking station).Definitely stay here again."

Felt really at home (Website hidden by Airbnb) I imagine anyone would.Everything one could think of is on hand here.Absolutely perfect location 5 min walk to city center but still feels quiet and calm at the apartment with views into the nearby Peoples park from the lounge windows.Cannot recommend highly enough...
36911477,2019-09-15,567,173869502,Meghan,"Best host ever! Had great amenities; cute, stylish little place and in a good location. Sian communicated often and was very clear and thorough with instructions, local tips, and the check-in and check-out process. Highly recommend."
7954546,2016-07-30,568,50601450,Dennis,Very pleased with our (Email hidden by Airbnb) fortable and well maintained 2 bedroom apartment that suited our family's needs perfectly.  Location was outstanding.  Paul met us on our arrival and gave us a quick run down on the unit as well as some local attractions.   All went perfectly.
7954546,2016-08-02,569,85108956,Marie-Noëlle,"Paul's appartment is really well located, very close to Temple bar area. It was not too noisy and we have had a good sleep.Paul's was very accomadating and we were able to leave our luggage at noon in order to be free to walk free in the city. The appartment is nice and very clean. As said by other travellers the water pressure is not very good but when you follow the instructions it' s ok, no problem with that.It was a pleasant (short) stay in Paul's appartment.Thanks you Paul.Marie"
7954546,2016-08-03,570,39664449,John & Sharon,"Perfectly located right in the heart of Dublin with easy access to everything including hop on hop off bus that goes right pass the front door. Very easy Walk to temple bar.  Yes it is a noisy location but you need to expect that when staying in this area.  There are loads of shops, restaurants and bars in the immediate area also. The unit has no television and although you do spend your days out and about it would be nice to go home and veg out in front of the tv for a while, especially when you are travelling for long periods like we are.  We had no issue with the hot water but as a tip, if you are using the washing machine then add a couple of jugs of water to it to help it along as there simply is not enough water pressure to fill it.The toilet was a bit of an issue as it would never fill enough to flush and was a little frustrating but that seems to be an issue in lots of places.The kitchen lacks a lot of utensils and there were no wine glasses or corkscrew which also key down the unit but the fresh flowers were a nice touch. Lovely clean unit, would stay again."
7954546,2016-08-07,571,6827500,Kristin,We loved the location of Pauls place. It is right in the center of the city and we loved being able to walk to everything! It is on a busy street and can be loud at night. I am a light sleeper but was fine with ear plugs. The amount of space was perfect for the 4 of us. We had some trouble working the washing machine - not sure if it was us or the machine - so if that is important to you make sure you ask how it works.  We would stay here again. 
7954546,2016-08-09,572,42732348,Tonya,Lovely central apartment. Very enjoyable stay
7954546,2016-08-12,573,45137132,Mellissa,"This was a perfect location for our stay in Dublin. We are a family of 4 with children, so it meant a lot that we could walk easily to the splendid sites. The flat was clean, and we truly appreciated having cereal, tea, coffee, and milk available for our breakfast. The four of us loved it, and we will most definitely stay here again when we visit Dublin next. "
7954546,2016-08-19,574,65472594,Joonas,"Thank you Paul for hosting us, we enjoyed our stay! The apartment was spacious and clean with a nice view to the river. A little bit of traffic below, but you can expect this in the city. Shopping center and lots of restaurants and pubs close by, National Museum, Jameson distillery and Guinness storehouse also within a healthy hike. :)"
7954546,2016-08-21,575,32162184,Jackie,"Location, Location, Location!The picture in the listing of the bridge over the River Liffey is not from a tourist site -- it is the view from the living room of Paul's fabulous Dublin flat. There couldn't be a better location. Less than a city block down from the Ha'Penny Bridge, the building fronts the River Liffey at the Millennium Bridge. Cross the River directly into Temple Bar, an area full of life, restaurants, bars and shops. The flat is clean and spacious with two comfortable bedrooms. Paul had excellent communication before and during our stay - checking into make sure we were comfortable and available for questions and local guidance. Worth noting is that because the location is so central, there are traffic and pedestrian noises that rise from the street. But that's urban living and well worth the trade off for the location. Overall an excellent find for a reasonable cost. Highly recommend. "
7954546,2016-08-23,576,42081888,Carol,"Paul's response with communications and directions were very timely and helpful . Titi was there to meet us with instructions although forgot to mention switch for hot water boost . Paul resolved that quickly . The  location couldn't be better to experience Dublin, but be aware that street noise on weekends may be a problem at night.  The breakfast supplies - coffee and French press particularly were enjoyed . Although little time was spent there loved the view of the river and Temple Bar from all three windows. Felt very secure although system of several locks and keys was a bit cumbersome. Thanks Paul for a great start to our Ireland trip . "
7954546,2016-08-26,577,64760237,Natasha,We stayed at Paul's place in Dublin for 3 nights. Perfect size for 4 people and the absolute best location! Very centrally located and in walking distance to all major attractions. It's on a busy street and can be a bit noisy but we enjoyed the location as it was perfect for us. 
7954546,2016-08-29,578,51881371,Linda,We were greeted by Titi as expected and he was on time. The location was great. A little noicy but that is to be expected when you stay somewhere central. Overall we were all very pleased with everything
7954546,2016-09-12,579,51750421,Marianne,Beskrivelsen svarede til det oplyste.
7954546,2016-09-15,580,6882377,Milly,"I don't routinely '5 star' everything, but this flat was great.Bang in the centre of Dublin, clean, tidy, spacious and a good layout AND with the food essentials which meant you didn't have to buy cereal etc.Paul was very accommodating regarding times and bedding, and when one of my party left a jacket and passport in the wardrobe (yes!) Paul came over with the key. And wasn't cross :-)Haven't got a bad word to say about it; would love to return."
7954546,2016-09-16,581,90497852,Mattia,"Appartamento molto bello ed accoliente.Zona centralissima proprio di fronte a Temple bar e affacciata sul fiume Liffey, e per questo la notte un pò caotica.Paul molto disponibile e risponde in breve tempo."
7954546,2016-09-21,582,11318801,David,The apartment at Ha'penny bridge was in a great location and we were able to walk to most places of interest. There was plenty of good restaurants nearby and was a good size for the 4 of us and very comfortable. Thank you Paul for the use of the apartment. 
7954546,2016-09-23,583,90687036,Jamie,Great location! Fresh flowers and fresh fruit in the apartment made it feel like home. Thanks for the welcoming accommodations.
7954546,2016-09-26,584,28307453,Zoe,"Listing was perfect, as described. Flat was very clean and everything was provided - Paul had even left cereal, fruit, tea, coffee and milk for us which was very kind. The location was brilliant, within walking distance of everything we needed. There was a bit of street noise during the night but this was to be expected due to the location and certainly didn't take away from overall experience. I would recommend Paul's flat to anyone wanting to throw themselves into the hustle and bustle of Dublin life!"
7954546,2016-09-28,585,83609182,Kerry,"We arrived in Dublin later than expected & Paul was working but was very accommodating.  He was pleasant to work with and provided us with what we needed for our visit.  The apartment is in a great location, we walked everywhere and covered 10 miles in one day site-seeing and shopping.  The apartment is near the Temple Bar area and even though it's across the river, Dublin is a lively city and we could hear the city noise late into the night.  We knew this when we reserved so it wasn't a surprise and it didn't impact our visit because we were so tired from exploring the city every night.Thank you for your hospitality Paul!Kerry"
7954546,2016-10-05,586,20990323,Judith,"I never got to meet Paul but, his friend Aliona welcomed us to the apartment.The apartment was exactly how it is depicted in the photos.  It was very clean and there was tea, coffee, milk and fresh flowers which made the apartment  very welcoming.The apartment is centrally located which makes it ideal for sightseeing.  There are a lot of restaurants right at the doorstep and the best by far is the Mortaland Cafe which is right next door.Being centrally located also means it can be quite noisy at night so I would suggest bringing a good set of earplugs.  As mentioned in a previous review there is no TV but ther is excellent wifi so if you have a tablet the TV won't be missed."
7954546,2016-10-06,587,65924442,Jose Antonio,Paul's place was exactly as described. A very nice and comfortable apartment next to River Liffey. Communication was smooth and everything was perfect. I recommend this place.
7954546,2016-10-22,588,22839234,Jonathan,"Paul arranged for the keys to be handed to us at the exact time we asked for them. The flat is very similar to how it is in the pictures, and the location is extremely convenient. The beds are big enough for two people each, so this can easily accommodate 4 people. It was a pleasant place to stay whilst passing through Dublin."
7954546,2016-10-24,589,69762422,Marwan,"Paul is a really good host, very responsive and really worked on the fine details that makes your overall experience outstanding.Location is super fantastic , in the heart of the city just few steps away from almost all the attractions you want to see in Dublin.Apartment was clean, and well maintained.Check in was easy and fast.Parking is just around the corner - a bit pricy - but still convenient."
7954546,2016-10-30,590,56459319,Jacqui,Fantastic location and lovely clean flat ... Thanks Paul for the cereal and milk we had a great time at Ha'penny Bridge.

Paul a tout fait pour répondre à nos attentes. Malheureusement il n'a pas pu venir car il travaillait. Le check in et check out se sont très bien déroulé. les explications étaient claires. Je recommande cet appartement"
7954546,2016-11-08,592,51031842,Sue,"The flat is in a perfect location for sightseeing, dining and shopping. The bus from the airport drops you off only a few blocks away. View of the river. Weekends can be a bit noisy however that did not bother us at all.  Everything was perfectly clean and comfy and there was coffee, tea and cereal in the morning . The flat is well appointed We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and highly recommend to anyone visiting Dublin. "
7954546,2016-11-13,593,58576495,Aurélie,"Appartement conforme à la description. Aucune mauvaise surprise.Idealement situé, proche de tous monuments,visites,shopping,vie nocturne de Temple Bar tout en étant à l'écart. Tout peut se faire à pied.Informations et conseils de Paul très utils (taxi,restaurant. ..).Appartement propre . Très bon séjour. "
7954546,2016-11-15,594,541839,Peggy,"Paul's place was incredibly convenient-we could walk everywhere we wanted to go-theater, museums, shops and restaurants. We were there in November and the heaters in the bedrooms kept us warm and cosy at night. The cereal, milk, coffee and tea were greatly appreciated. Centrally located, it does come with a bit of noise, but that's the price you pay for staying in the center of a bustling city."
7954546,2016-11-23,595,52859787,Angie,Paul's place is very accurately described. He recommendations for local restaurants were also great. We really enjoyed our stay. Very close to all the local pubs and attractions. 
36911477,2019-09-16,596,271795719,Amanda,"Sian’s place is clean, chic, and in a beautiful location. She’s a thoughtful host who took care of us in every way! 10/10!"

7954546,2016-11-27,598,1521721,Rilee,"Paul's apartment was the perfect place for our first trip to Dublin. It was more than spacious enough for 4 adults, and it was so centrally located to all of the most popular sites in Dublin... including just across the river from Temple Bar. Would love to return to Dublin and stay again one day!"
36911477,2019-10-27,599,90684824,Damien,"This little gem of a place is not to be missed amazing value in a great location within minutes of everything ,Sian was a brilliant host will be back"
7954546,2016-12-03,600,34253958,Mark,"The location is central to Dublin,Temple Bar,OConnell street and the Laos Transport system. All walkable within 5 minutes. Great selection of restaurants.Reception was great and the apartment was quiet."
7954546,2016-12-04,601,33222947,Kerri,Fantastic location.  Close to temple bar and just minutes away from shops on henry street and jervis shopping centre.  Easy to find and Paul was very helpful.  Would bookagain.
7954546,2016-12-09,602,2003304,Nadiye,"Central location close to lovely bars traditional pubs and restaurants, shopping centre nearby with M&S food, Tesco and Boots. Lovely Italian called something like cafe italia which is a must for an authentic experience. They are v busy early evening but tables free up after 8.Paul was a great host, the apartment was easy to access even with our buggy as the loft has ample space. Nice, clean well decorated apartment and we will stay again! "
7954546,2016-12-11,603,31951628,Janet,"Had a lovely stay at Paul's apartment. Great central location, exceptionally clean and warm (even in December). would highly recommend Panem cafe downstairs, and the Bison Bar, over the bridge and turn right for bbq smoked food with sides."
7954546,2016-12-12,604,2003304,Nadiye,"The apartment is in a super location right by the Millennium Bridge so it's perfect for exploring the city and everything is on your doorstep. The place was immaculately clean and tidy throughout and nicely presented inside. Admittedly some parts are a bit dated- the windows are v old and a bit draughty but the weather was mild so we weren't too affected by it. We stayed here twice within a week, either side of a wedding we attended in Connemara. The first visit was absolutely flawless, on our second trip there was an issue with the water in the building and so it was off from 9am and we struggled to get any hot water that morning. However I'm sure that was just a blip possibly building wide and it wouldn't put us off staying again.Both bedrooms were good doubles with storage, the reception was a good size and all windows overlook the Liffey for fun views. The flat was well heated and being across the river from Temple bar wasn't really noisy at all. Paul was a great host and we would love to stay again."
7954546,2016-12-19,605,98632830,Jana,"Paul's place was located in a prime spot for touring the city of Dublin. It was within walking distance of all tourist attractions, pubs, restaurants, and shopping.  It was also easy to get to from the bus stop. Paul was great communicating with me via email prior to our arrival which put us at ease.  He then met with us upon arrival and explained all details of the apartment. He had coffee, tea and breakfast foods available for us. The only negative was the noise from the busy street below. People partying until the wee hours of the morning. It was difficult to sleep some nights. With that being said the location out weighed that. Perfect place to stay!!"
7954546,2016-12-24,606,103885167,Jamie,Paul was a terrific host.  The apartment was just as described and the location is perfect for exploring Dublin.  We really enjoyed our stay at this apartment and will definitely stay here again in the future.
7954546,2016-12-30,607,16431157,Richard,A very pleasant flat in a great location for the centre of Dublin.  
7954546,2017-01-02,608,57647546,Charlotte,"The apartment had more than enough space, and the location was absolutely perfect. I would definitely recommend it to a friend!"
7954546,2017-01-03,609,39179139,Marie-Hélène,Wow wow wow! Everything was perfect and so so clean! Paul was really easy to contact and helpful! Location of the appartment is perfect to discover Dublin by walk! If you're heading Dublin go with it!
7954546,2017-01-04,610,39179139,Marie-Hélène,Everything was perfect!
7954546,2017-01-08,611,31914593,Sarah,"This apartment is in a great central location. It can be a little bit noisy at night due to this location but we never had any trouble sleeping. Paul is incredibly accommodating with late check-ins, he also provides coffee and breakfast stuff which is really handy. The apartment itself is spacious and light - both double bedrooms are big, and is great value for money. A good place to base yourself when staying in Dublin. "
7954546,2017-01-20,612,35987698,Andrew,"Perfect location, clean, comfortable and paul was very helpful throughout  the entire process.  Little details like the fresh flowers, fruit and cereal really made for a great stay. Thanks Paul! "
7954546,2017-01-23,613,46376040,Signe,"When just spending a couple of days in Dublin, this apartment is just perfect. In the midst of town, with everything within walking distance we had the best time. "
7954546,2017-01-30,614,22150832,Ute,"We were 4 adults. There was only one key for us. We had different interests. Cause of the key, we had to come and go at the same time. The locking system is complicated. Therefore you have to go down and open the door for each person, who is coming back."
7954546,2017-02-09,615,62977777,Pete,"This apartment is in a great location with great views. We have stayed in the Clarence Hotel and preferred the flexibility and larger space of staying here. Our stay was midweek and other than traffic noise we did not hear any noise from Temple Bar, this might be different at weekends but you can't have the convenience of the location without some noise! We heard very little noise from the neighbors. Checkin and checkout were very easy. A TV would have been good and the mattresses on the beds are quite thin but these are minor details for a short stay. Overall we were very happy and would come back. We had a car but this wasn't a problem as we used the car park on Jervis Street a minutes walk a way. Down this street there is also a shopping centre with an M and S foodhall which was very useful. There are loads of great restaurants and cafes nearby. We also enjoyed the tapas at the Market Bar in fantastic surroundings."
7954546,2017-02-11,616,100704636,Victoria,"Perfect apartment for 4 friends, had absolutely everything we needed. Great location for a few nights in Dublin, close to great bars with life music and all the sites. Paul was an amazing host and the communication was so easy - there were lots of things in the kitchen that made things so smooth. The only problem was that we had was very limited hot water. Everything else was amazing, would stay here again in a heartbeat!   "
7954546,2017-02-14,617,31335905,Richard,"Well located with brilliant view of Millenium Bridge and the Liffey, and 5 mins from Temple Bar. Very good cafes and restaurants almost next door."
7954546,2017-02-16,618,78667619,Martin,"Great location, very central! Clean a spacious apartment."
7954546,2017-02-22,619,27171604,Tessie,"The location is perfect! You can walk almost anywhere and from all the windows you have a great view  of the river Liffey as well as Temple Bar. The flat was extremely clean and the kitchen was well-equipped and stocked with breakfast cereal, tea and coffee. The downside of great location is of course street noise. On weekends the street outside is full of partying people, and on weekday mornings there is a lot of traffic. The February weather was very damp and the windows do not filter out street noise or dampness. We had some issues with the toilet tank filling up slowly. The beds are not very comfortable. But in all, the positives clearly outweighed the negatives. "

7954546,2017-03-22,624,118433044,Josh,Many great places to eat around paul's space. and really all around the southern part of temple bar as well. You really can see the river from his place.

7954546,2017-04-20,633,14891462,Sarah,"The location was perfect for wandering around the city. Yes the road was busy during the day but it didn't bother us at night time, it's what you have to expect for being so centrally located. There were plenty of great cafes and restaurants nearby and the central shopping street was less than 10 mins walk away. We didn't need to get a taxi or bus anywhere in the city as it's so walkable. The apartment was clean and well stocked, if a little basic but was great value for the price, brilliant value for money. Check in was smooth and without a hitch. Overall a great budget apartment with an amazing location for wandering around the city. "
7954546,2017-04-26,634,49540808,Erik,"Clean, comfortable and centrally located -- couldn't ask for much more in terms of the space. Paul was a reliable host and very professional. Would highly recommend. "
7954546,2017-04-27,635,119116442,David,"Hi Paul.Pretty much all was good. We particularly liked the fact that you had left some provisions. Your apartment was clean and well appointed, but surprisingly you don't have a bottle opener.One criticism however, is the bed in the right hand room. It creaks and groans at the slightest movement, and prevented a good night's sleep.Otherwise all was good.Regards,Dave."

We were also allowed to use the washing machine which was a lifesaver!! The apartment is little bit of a hike away from the city centre but very reasonable, never took a taxi once while I was there."
36863389,2019-07-30,639,248621465,Rosie,"What a find this place is!! I had the best stay at Deirdre’s home. It is stylish and clean and Deirdre made me feel right at home and welcome with her great recommendations of places to go, yummy breakfast, and warm disposition. The bed is super comfortable and the room is simple and perfect. I loved using the outdoor garden space as well! The location is just outside of the main city area enough where it’s quiet and peaceful but close enough to walk easily to wherever you want to go. I could not speak more highly of this place!! I will DEFINITELY be recommending it to anyone who travels to Dublin!"

7954546,2017-05-25,647,121707519,Teresa,"Paul was an incredible host and his place was beautiful! He was very responsive from the initial booking all the way through our arrival and stay. He also had great suggestions on where to go and what to do and told us what activities needed advanced booking - we were only in Dublin for a couple days so his knowledge saved us from having to wait in long lines. His apartment was amazing - it looked over River Liffey and was very sunny in the morning, which is always a great way to start the day. It's centrally located so we were able to walk everywhere. I'd highly recommend staying with Paul if you're thinking about visiting Dublin!"
7954546,2017-05-30,648,110823301,Andrea,Very convenient to Temple Bar area just across the bridge and other tourist areas. This does come with street noise including traffic and loud (drunk) pedestrian noise on the two nights we stayed. The accommodations are just as shown in the photos. Check in was very easy. 
7954546,2017-06-02,649,33435779,Shari,"Paul's apartment is very large, with a living/dining room and two bedrooms.  While it was noisy, and the beds were a bit uncomfortable, the apartment does have delightfully wide window ledges on which you can sit and watch the hustle of the streets or the flow of the river.  Great location for visiting Temple Bar area and five minute walk from the Air Coach bus stop to and from the airport."

7954546,2017-06-10,654,94306291,Bob,"Location to city and Temple Bar is great. Property clean and comfortable but some amenities leave room for improvement, such as hot water system and beds."
7954546,2017-06-11,655,57378297,Kelly,"We loved this place! Great location and it was very easy to check in and out. The only trouble was that the wifi didn't work the entire time, we tried to get in touch with Paul but did not hear back in time since we were only staying one night. We also had trouble with the shower, mostly cold water. Not sure if we forgot to flip a switch or something. Overall, this location suited our needs since we were only in Dublin for the night, we got to see a lot of the downtown area!"
7954546,2017-06-12,656,70894455,Seodhna,"Very central, great apartment, Paul was very helpful and great communication"
7954546,2017-06-15,657,128769868,Christina,Paul's place was really great and exactly as described! We would love to stay there again.
7954546,2017-06-17,658,95466199,Brigid,"Paul’s place is bright, roomy, comfortable and centrally located. It’s easily accessible, and a short walk to many popular sites in Dublin. The view overlooking the Liffey is delightful. Paul contacted me with details well in advance of my arrival and had someone meet me at the apartment to hand over the keys and show me around. I got to check in early which was a kind relief after a long night’s travel. The kitchen was stocked with basic necessities and there was even fresh fruit. Since the place is right on the street, it’s a little noisy, but it didn’t really bother me. I had some trouble with the hot water—it’s seemed like a tricky system which was a little beyond me. But other than that my stay was most pleasant and effortless."
7954546,2017-06-20,659,66339184,Laura,Very central located flatClose to temple bar& shopping street& meeting points for tours easy going regarding time of check in and out 
7954546,2017-06-21,660,21254168,Alex,"Everything was as described. Excellent stay and I would definitely come back. Great location in central Dublin. Apartment was spacious and clean, with plenty of provisions for our stay. "

7954546,2017-06-25,662,61662490,Albert,"Great central location, nice building, safe. clean, all what is necessary available. Only issue was the wifi, hope it works out well next time. Paul tried to fix but may be external problem. Paul keeps regularly in contact to make sure all is fine."
7954546,2017-06-26,663,4967850,Jordan,"Across the river from Temple Bar neighborhood. The apartment was basic, but was nice for a short stay. The wifi did not work for our stay, but the host did make an attempt to fix it. Great location and can access most of the tourist destinations on foot. "
7954546,2017-06-29,664,38800086,Glenn,Nice big apartment right in the center of the city!
7954546,2017-07-02,665,71154299,Nicole,"The location is fantastic and the views are gorgeous.  Our only issue was we could not figure out how to turn on the hot water at all. Other than that, it was as described and check in and out was easy. "
7954546,2017-07-03,666,2343532,Yuri Michael,"Paul's apartment is located right on the river, facing the Millennium Bridge, within walking distance to all major attractions in the city center, so you can't ask for a more convenient location. The apartment has two separate bedrooms and a good-sized living room. The place is very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed staying there. "
7954546,2017-07-06,667,112005931,Brian,"Paul's place is in a great location! Everything is in walking distance! Temple Bar, with all its pubs and restaurants, is just across the river, a minute away! Our only complaint was that we had some trouble at times getting hot water, but I think that's to be expected there."
7954546,2017-07-07,668,46888470,Jack,"Great location right in the heart of Dublin, very clean and spacious with a top notch view of the river. Would definitely stay again!"

7954546,2017-07-25,674,100647239,Régis,Bon emplacement Sdb petite
7954546,2017-07-26,675,62488673,Suzanne,Great place to stay. Very close to all the major site seeing places and temple bar. Check in and check out were smooth and well organised. Great recommendations given. Good communicator. Flat was clean and tidy with fresh flowers on arrival. Would recommend.
7954546,2017-07-31,676,98582904,Elisabet,"Fantastiskt läge några våningar upp i detta hus nära Millennium Bridge och med utsikt över folklivet när man vilar sig från det mellan varven. Fönster ut mot floden Liffey och bara att promenera över någon av alla broar för att komma till nöjeskvarteren på södra sidan. På samma sida som lägenheten (norr) något lugnare område med många boende och kvarterspubar att slinka in på. Bussar för turer på O'Connell Street och större affärsgator några kvarter längre upp. Rekommenderar särskilt the Lotts som har både en bar på hörnet och en större pub med rejäl och vällagad mat. Allt inom gångavstånd. Flygbussen stannar vid Eden Quay några hundra meter ifrån  men du kliver på vid spiran på O'Connell Street. Välstädad och omsorgsfullt omhändertagen lägenhet. En del matvaror i pentry och kyl fanns att börja med, inkl bryggkaffe och en kanna att göra presskaffe i, gott om broschyrer och kartor, Spar-butik runt hörnet och en större två hörn bort, än högre upp finns exempelvis M&S, fanns bra med utrustning som diskmedel, toapapper och schampo, sängkläder och handdukar. Tvättmaskin finns men vi använde den inte. Bredband finns: vi kunde lätt göra biljettbokningar direkt när vi bestämt vilka biljettbokningar vi ville göra. Bra med sittmöbler och vi åt frukost ""hemma"" varje dag innan vi gav oss ut på äventyr - praktiskt. (Aningens smala dubbelsängar för oss breda och långa vikingar.) Tack till värden, som vi tyvärr inte träffade, men allt fungerade perfekt med annan person som installerade oss. Fick en mycket bra bild av Dublin och Irland och boendet är en viktig del av detta!"
7954546,2017-08-02,677,41627476,Todd,"If you are looking for a perfect location to explore Dublin from, this is it!  The view from the window of the Millennium Bridge is actually better than the picture.  It is nothing fancy, but clean, relatively modern, and safe.  Our flight was delayed and we were able to communicate and adjust our check in on the fly.  Be aware that the city location does come with some noise at night from cars / buses and those returning from the Temple Bar area - to us that was part of the experience of being in Dublin - just don't expect a silent night."
7954546,2017-08-07,678,48686920,Rebecca,The apartment is just across the river from Temple Bar and all that offers.  Very convenient to shopping and restaurants as well as Christchurch.  Paul was a great host and responded very quickly when we had last minute travel delays.
7954546,2017-08-11,679,3507856,Manon,"We enjoyed the location and view from this apartment.  Apartment was clean, and we had a nice welcoming. Basics in the fridge, fresh fruit and fresh flowers. Expect noise from the street, juste across the millenium bridge to Temple bar.  For us mattresses were uncomfortable, too ""springy"".  The rest of the furniture was up to date."
7954546,2017-08-12,680,67598095,Sharon,"Paul's place was brilliant. It had everything we needed for our short stay of 1 night. Location was right beside where we needed to be for the night so super convenient in the city centre. The Apartment was really clean, neat & bright. Kitchen was well equipped with things, including complimentary tea, coffee, milk & cereal which is a lovely touch. Loved the view of the river Liffey. A little noisy at night until things settled down with traffic & people but that did not bother us. Apartment complex so secure with keys & fobs for everything. Complex very quiet & clean. The only negative I have is the mattress in 1 of the beds was very uncomfortable. The springs were very superficial so I could feel them and had to sleep along a pillow. This would not prevent me from staying here again however , as it is good value for money & location & cleanliness are most important for me. Check in was seamless. I had contact numbers if needed but there was no need. Thanks Paul!"
7954546,2017-08-14,681,944427,Claudia,"Paul is responding very fast and has an open ear for any issue. The introduction was quite short, I recommend to try the hot water boiler during the check-in process. The beds are okay but not made to stay for a week.  If you spend a weekend with friends for 2-3 nights this is the perfect location for you. You are staying right in the middle of Dublin opposite Temple Bar District."
7954546,2017-08-15,682,59508188,Kathy,"Unimaginably great location in city center, completely walkable.  We had hot water problems but it was tolerable for a one night stay, and Paul did attempt to fix during our time there.  Communication is slow, but he is pleasant.  Be aware there is no tv, but excellent wifi."
7954546,2017-08-16,683,18182825,Ajay,"Excellent apt with stunning views from both bedrooms and the lounge, loved staying there with a perfectly central location and would definitely look to book the same again many thanks"
7954546,2017-08-17,684,22101397,David,Nice apartment.  Great location.
7954546,2017-08-21,685,107918264,Seike,"Lage des Appartements super, sanitäre Einrichtungen mangelhaft, Probleme mit dem Wasser, Dusche und WC"
7954546,2017-08-25,686,1442143,Dawn,"Clean, spacious apartment in THE BEST location for walking to all the sites, or hopping on/off public transit. Easy check-in and out, and great communication from Paul with all my questions answered quickly. Also lovely that the apartment is stocked with essentials needed for cooking/light meals. Wi-fi is also super fast. The only downside of this great apartment is that there is a lot of noise at night from traffic, and people; but again that's because of the super central location. I'd highly recommend this apartment for your Dublin stay!"
7954546,2017-08-26,687,9510039,Allesandra,Paul's place is in a great location and he was very helpful with suggestions for places to check out.
7954546,2017-09-04,688,1657813,Julian,"Paul's place is a real treat. Great location, close to several shops and bars around the temple bar area but also surprisingly quiet given the spot is located. We also enjoyed the views to the Liffey and very comfortable rooms. Communication with Paul was perfect and check in and check out very well organised.  Would definitely recommend it!"
7954546,2017-09-06,689,20226291,Ryan,"The location of the apartment can't be beat. It is roomy and clean. We had some problems with having enough hot water, and the beds aren't very comfortable. Other than those two things it was a great place to stay."
7954546,2017-09-07,690,13795440,Alicia,"All in, this place was good. Check in process was difficult for someone coming from overseas without cell service. We were not able to get the information in advance of our flights (6 days early). Beds were not comfortable and there was not enough hot water for two people in the morning. Location was great and place was very clean, all depends on what kind of accommodations you need."
7954546,2017-09-09,691,87212047,Julie,Excellent location overlooking the Liffey.
7954546,2017-09-12,692,41272250,Monica,The location was great and the view was even better!
7954546,2017-09-13,693,149587124,Liam,"Very central location, apartment is very clean and airy. Check in was very straight forward, and communication with Paul was efficient and thorough. Would definitely stay here again."
7954546,2017-09-14,694,147256754,John,Awesome view and location
7954546,2017-09-15,695,62322215,Joyce,"We had a terrific time staying at Paul's place. The location was perfect, close to tons of sites and restaurants, which was helpful as our time in Dublin was short. The apartment was very clean and exactly as described. Paul was super helpful and quick to respond to any questions we had. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Paul's place to anyone visiting Dublin, but especially those who have limited time to explore the city."
7954546,2017-09-18,696,76309968,Anne,"Un peu déçu par cette deuxième expérience en Airbnb. Nous avons attendu une demi heure que la jeune femme vienne nous ouvrir. ( Nous n avons pas rencontré Paul). C était vraiment stressant, surtout à 21h30"
7954546,2017-09-19,697,50831674,Kimberly,Paul's place is exactly as described. It is the perfect location! Communication prior to arrival was outstanding! I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone.
7954546,2017-09-20,698,82121606,J,Paul's place is a great central location when visiting City Centre. His communication was excellent and the apartment worked out well for a short stay.
7954546,2017-09-23,699,122266824,Bryan,"The flat was clean and simple, and you can't beat the location!  Many of the other comments reflect what to expect - so I highly recommend reading through them especially if from the US.  Biggest concern was hot water (not enough), and the fact that there was only ONE key set.  There are MANY locks/doors to actually get to the apartment, and only have one key means a larger party doesn't have the luxury of being able to go in/out of the apartment without coordinating.  But all in all, it was a nice place if you want to be in the heart of Dublin."
