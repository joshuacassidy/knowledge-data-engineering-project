43881314,646307787,2020-08-03,187536638,Eimear,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Westport - the chalet was in a perfect location for us and the facilities were ideal. On a busy bank holiday weekend the area was full of fellow tourists and when we struggled to get a restaurant booking we got takeaway pizza in a place recommended by Darren, sat in front of our turf fire and opened a bottle of wine! On arrival Darren called the local pub and not only got us a last minute table but also dropped us down.
